"""How a hop to a relocatable node is routed, and what that route does to the leak count (#1350).

New file: egress.py's own test module sits at its file-budget ceiling, and this covers the piece
#1350 adds — the address-shape classifier and the two route states it introduces.

The four edges this is really about (`p2pool`->`monerod`, `p2pool`->`tari`, `dashboard`->`monerod`,
`dashboard`->`tari`) all claimed `local` before this, three of them hardcoded. One render could
already contradict itself: with a remote monerod the node was marked `remote` and p2pool's hop to
it said `clearnet`, while the dashboard's hop to the SAME daemon still said `local`.

The resting config these tests build on used to be a local ``SAFE`` dict mirroring
``test_egress.SAFE``.  #1541 merged the two into ``tests/service/conftest.py``, which is what the
``_posture``, ``_topo`` and ``_edge`` fixtures below read; the merged dict is the UNION, so these
tests now pin three notify-* keys they used to leave at their signature defaults.  The conftest
docstring records why that is a no-op and what it costs.
