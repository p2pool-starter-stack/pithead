"""The audit row id is sanitized (#1561) and is a one-to-one function of its parts (#1566).

``_record_audit_event`` cleans five fields through ``audit_service._clean`` and used to pass the
sixth — ``id``, the ``audit_events`` PRIMARY KEY — through untouched. On the rig-edit path that id
is built from an unauthenticated worker's ``change_id``, validated upstream only as a non-empty
``str`` inside a body capped at 1 MiB. ``audit_events`` ages rows out at 30 days (#1814), so an
oversized id is no longer permanent — but it is unbounded in SIZE for that whole window, which is
the stake #1561 is about.

``build_event_id`` is the other half and the same stake: the id is the ``audit_events`` PRIMARY KEY
under ``INSERT OR IGNORE``, so two distinct detections that mint the same id do not become two rows
or an error — the second is DROPPED. #1561 bounds how large that field can be; #1566 makes the
mapping into it one-to-one.

Both halves are here because they are one behaviour and either alone is a false pass: the contract
tests would stay green if ``_record_audit_event`` never called the helper, and the wiring test would
stay green against a naive truncation that silently merges two detections.
