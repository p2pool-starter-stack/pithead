"""The #724 flood cap's bound on the DEVICE-CHOSEN name space (#1695).

Split from ``test_worker_change_audit.py`` rather than folded into it: that file proves the
per-worker rate bound, this one proves the bound on how many names may hold such a window at once
— a different defect class, and the one that decides whether the cap bounds a name or a device.

Tier 1, against a real in-memory ``StateManager``, through the real caller, and reusing that
file's harness so both halves of one cap are exercised the same way.
