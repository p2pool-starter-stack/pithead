"""Click-to-adopt (#893): the dashboard-side mirror of pithead's per-entry shape validation and
the add-only diff it pre-checks before ``handle_control_preview`` ever spools a proposal.

Each test names the guard it kills so a later change that quietly weakens one shows up as a
specific broken test, not a vague coverage drop:
  - a REMOVED check (the ``if`` deleted, or the function always returning "") would let every
    bad case in this file through as if it were valid — the "malformed X refused" tests kill that.
  - an INVERTED check (``==`` for ``!=``, a dropped ``not``) would refuse every GOOD case instead
    — the "well-formed entry accepted" tests kill that.
  - a widened/narrowed diff boundary (off-by-one on the prefix length) would misclassify an edit
    to an existing entry as "new", or lose a genuinely new tail entry — the prefix-boundary tests
    kill that.
