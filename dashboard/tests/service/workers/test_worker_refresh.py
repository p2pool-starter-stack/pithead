"""The #1233 bounded out-of-cycle worker refresh: fires on a worker-upgrade result meaning the rig
rebuilt, never on one meaning it didn't, and gives up cleanly within its attempt cap.

Mutation-kill notes:
  - dropping the ``entry.get("ip")`` guard would try to probe a worker with no address — the
    "no ip -> no-op" test kills that.
  - inverting ``_UPGRADE_REFRESH_STATUSES`` membership (or the ``in`` to ``not in``) would fire the
    refresh on a rejected/failed upgrade, or skip a genuinely successful one — the paired
    "fires on applied/accepted" / "does not fire on rejected/failed/rolled_back/throttled/noop"
    tests kill either direction.
  - removing the attempt cap (or the sleep-then-probe ordering) would spin forever on a rig that
    never reports the target version — the "gives up after N attempts" test bounds the call count.
  - dropping the version-match early exit would burn every attempt even after a match lands —
    the "stops on first matching version" test asserts the call count stops short of the cap.
