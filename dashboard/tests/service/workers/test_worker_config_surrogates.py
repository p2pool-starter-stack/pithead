"""The lone-surrogate binds on the unauthenticated worker feed (#1696).

A new module for the same reason ``test_worker_revision.py`` is one: ``test_storage_worker.py``,
where these three methods are otherwise tested, sits at its recorded file-budget ceiling (451/451).
The subject is the same store, so the tests-ROOT ``state_manager`` fixture from
``dashboard/tests/conftest.py`` serves here unchanged.

The file is named for a defect CLASS rather than a method because that is what it is: one input
class reaching three separate binds. A rig chooses ``change_id``, its own worker ``name`` and
``reason`` on the enriched read feed; ``json.loads`` hands a lone surrogate back verbatim; sqlite3
encodes a TEXT parameter as strict UTF-8 and raises ``UnicodeEncodeError``. That is a ``ValueError``
and NOT a ``sqlite3.Error``, so it walked through every fail-closed handler in the store and out
through the caller's ``asyncio.to_thread``, aborting the poll step — an unauthenticated LAN device
stopping a step of the poll with one character.

Three binds were swept and left alone, each for a reason rather than by omission:
``revision`` and ``last_change_id`` reach ``note_worker_revision`` only through
``parse_config_meta``, whose ``_TOKEN_RE`` charset a surrogate cannot match; and the two readers
``get_worker_config_change`` and ``get_worker_revision_drift`` take a route-supplied worker name
beside an already-tokenised id. What is NOT swept here is every other table this worker name
reaches outside this store — that is a wider question than this issue.

Every hostile case below is paired with a control, because "did not raise" is the weakest
assertion there is: ``TestTheSurrogateIsGenuinelyHostile`` proves the fixture value really does
break a bind on THIS connection, so a green run here is the guard working rather than a value that
was never dangerous in the first place.
