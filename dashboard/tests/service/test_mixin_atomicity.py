"""The mixin split's safety property, as an instrument rather than a report of one (#1369).

`plans/1105-cut-map.md` refused splitting `storage_service.py`: multi-table atomic ops need the
single DB-handle class, and a facade would put a seam between callers and that handle. A MIXIN
falls outside that refusal — same class, same instance, same `self`, same connection, same
transaction scope — but only while the property the refusal protects actually holds:

    no method that MOVED to a mixin may call a method that STAYED BEHIND while the DB lock or an
    open transaction is held.

A call that spans that boundary is the seam the cut map refused to create, and nothing else in
the suite would notice it: the code would still work, and the split would still read as safe.

This file ships with the split so the property is re-checked by CI on every later PR, not proven
once and then trusted. A proof a reviewer cannot re-run is an assertion with a table around it; a
proof that runs once cannot stop the NEXT cut regressing it silently.

**On the controls.** `test_the_checker_flags...` seeds a moved method calling a retained one
INSIDE the guard — across the moved/retained boundary, in the direction the question asks. That
shape is the one that matters: a control built only from retained methods cannot exercise the
classifier that decides the question, so a checker that always answered "not moved, skip" would
pass it cleanly and still report zero spanning calls. A control that fires proves the instrument
can see something; only a control that crosses the boundary proves it can see the thing.
