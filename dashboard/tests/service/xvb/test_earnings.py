"""Unit tests for the expected-earnings model (mining_dashboard/service/xvb/earnings.py).

The model is one linear rate — XMR per H/s per day — derived from the live block reward and
network difficulty. These tests pin the math (including the worked field example), the units, and
the graceful-degradation behaviour when inputs are missing. The client scales this rate to the
what-if hashrate; that scaling/formatting is tested in tests/frontend/logic.test.mjs.
