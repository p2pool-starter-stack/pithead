"""#1487 — an error and an answer may not share a return channel, as a mechanism (#1409).

#1409 was one instance: `get_worker_config_history` returned `[]` both when the read failed and
when it succeeded and found nothing. Its caller reads that list to decide where a rig's running
config came from, and an empty list means *"we hold no row"*, which renders as **"Last changed
from another dashboard."** A database that failed to open produced an on-screen accusation that
another operator had changed the rig.

#1487 asked for a MECHANISM rather than a sweep of the instances, because fixing them one at a
time makes today's known instances safe and does nothing about the next one. This is that
mechanism, and the rule it enforces is:

    a FAILURE path may not return a value that inhabits the function's declared SUCCESS type.

**The opt-out is the type annotation, not a marker comment.** A handler that genuinely wants to
collapse says so by declaring a type the collapsed value fits; a handler that wants the failure to
be distinguishable widens its annotation to `T | None` and returns `None`. That is exactly the fix
#1409 applied, so the mechanism and the precedent agree by construction, and "a decision someone
signed rather than a default nobody noticed" is expressible in the signature a reader already
reads. Nothing here needs a new vocabulary.

## The two shapes this covers, and the one it does not

* **The `except` shape.** A collapsed literal returned from an exception handler.
* **The HANDLE-GUARD shape.** `if not self._conn: return []` — no exception involved. This is the
  SILENT half of #1409, the route that raised nothing and logged nothing, and it is invisible to
  any rule anchored on `except`. It is covered here because the two shapes are the same defect
  reached by two doors, and a gate that closed only one would leave the door the reader cannot see.

**It does NOT cover the general guard-clause shape, and does not claim to.** A guard on a DOMAIN
value — `if not rows`, `if prev is None`, `if cmd is None` — is usually a real early return rather
than a failure. Re-derived at this tip: 171 guard-clause failure-return sites, of which 32 test a
resource handle and 139 test a domain value; an earlier precision pass over the wider class found a
single true positive in it. The discriminator kept here is that the guard tests a RESOURCE HANDLE.
Widening past that would trade a gate people trust for a gate people mute; the near-miss control
below pins the narrowness so it cannot drift.

## What is asserted, and what is only reported

Two laws are HARD, and neither needs a baseline of existing instances:

1. **The signed set stays signed** (`_SIGNED`). Five functions are PINNED there, #1409's own fix
   among them — not every function the classifier scores signed. Dropping the `| None` from a pinned
   one would return it to the collapsed class silently: the regression this file exists to prevent.
2. **A signature that promises an out-of-band failure must honour it.** If a function's annotation
   admits `None`, every failure return in it must BE `None`, not an empty container. This is a
   self-consistency law with no baseline at all: it is clean today, it stays clean forever, and it
   catches the half-done fix — the except arm corrected while the handle guard is left returning
   `[]`, which is precisely the per-site shape a per-function reading of #1409 would miss.

The remaining collapses are **REPORTED, NOT CERTIFIED**, and the reporting test asserts nothing
about their number. This is deliberate and it is the whole ruling on this file:

> **A baseline is a RATCHET.** Baselining the current instances would mark whatever real defects
> they contain as permanently accepted — converting "a default nobody noticed" into "a default
> someone signed", with the same nobody having read them, and a GREEN GATE now asserting the state
> is intentional. That is #1487's own failure mode reintroduced one level up, concealed by the
> gate's own greenness. It is also the shape #1409 arrived in: `docs/dashboard.md` had written the
> defect down as a safety property.

So the un-read instances get no row, no ratchet, and no green. They get a count and their names.

## The residual, stated as a measurement AT A NAMED SHA

Every figure here is measured over live source, so it drifts under refactors unrelated to
annotation, in both directions: quote one with the sha you took it at, and never hang an imperative
on the number (#1556). At `b0a32bd`, the tip this shipped against — **11 collapses** flagged (all in
the DB read layer), **5 signed**, **0 half-fixes**, **57 blind**. At `a0ddbec` plus this slice
(`client/xvb_client.py`) — **11**, **10**, **0**, **52**, since joined by `unjudged` **1** (#1556)
and `procedure` **3** (#1581) at `17722da` — six, which `classify` asserts are exhaustive. #1556
annotated the blind layer slice by slice and CLOSED it at 12; the flagged count rose as it did.

`add_payouts` is worth naming out of the 11, because it shows the class is not academic here: a
failed INSERT returns `[]`, indistinguishable from "every row was already stored", and that value
is what drives the `payout_confirmed` alert. The alert that does not fire is the failure's only
symptom.
