"""#1487's classifier, as a module two test files can share.

It started inside `test_collapsed_return_channels.py`, which is the file that argued the rule and
still owns it. The rule is:

    a FAILURE path may not return a value that inhabits the function's declared SUCCESS type.

`test_collapsed_return_channels.py` holds the argument, the controls, and the two hard laws.
`test_annotation_coverage.py` holds #1556's per-module pin laws, and two plain modules beside it
hold the data those laws run over: `annotation_pins.py` (which modules are pinned, and each one's
anchor) and `annotation_readings.py` (the `unjudged` functions somebody read, with the reading).
Both need the same walk over the package, and a sibling test module is not importable by name here
— `--import-mode=importlib` with no `__init__.py` means `from test_collapsed_return_channels import
classify` raises `ModuleNotFoundError`. That is why this is a non-test module rather than a helper
left where it was, and why the two data modules are plain modules too.

Import it as `from tests.service.annotation_gate import ...`. `tests` resolves as a namespace
package because pytest runs with `dashboard/` on `sys.path`; both the `make test-dashboard`
invocation (`cd dashboard && ... python -m pytest`) and the bare console script were checked.

Nothing here is a test. The verdicts it produces mean nothing without the controls in
`test_collapsed_return_channels.py`, which seed each shape ACROSS the boundary this file decides
on — a classifier that answered "safe" to everything would pass any check built only from
already-safe shapes.

    ``half_fix`` — declares one and returns an empty container anyway (law 2's quarry).
    ``collapse`` — declares a type the failure value fits, so no caller can tell them apart.
    ``blind`` — unannotated, and therefore outside what this mechanism can judge.
    ``unjudged`` — annotated, declares NO out-of-band marker, and the failure value is outside
    `_EMPTY`. The gate takes no position on these, and the fifth list exists so that taking no
    position is a thing it SAYS rather than a thing it does silently.
    ``procedure`` — declared `-> None`, so there is no success value for a failure to hide inside
    and #1487's rule genuinely cannot apply. Out of scope, and SAID rather than skipped (#1581).

    Exhaustively is the load-bearing word, and the assertion at the end enforces it. Every law
    built on this result is phrased as an absence — "nothing under this module is blind" — and an
    absence is satisfied perfectly by its subject never being classified at all. That has happened
    twice now, by two different exits, and neither looked wrong where it stood.

    The fifth and sixth verdicts were both added after a measured defect of exactly this shape —
    #1556 for `unjudged`, #1581 for `procedure`. Taking the fifth: without it these functions fell
    off the end of the branch chain and appeared in no list at all, so a pin asserting "nothing
    under this module is blind" was satisfied by a function VANISHING. Dropping `| None` from a
    signed function moves it here, not to `blind` — which is the one regression #1556's ratchet
    exists to catch, and it was invisible. Two sub-cases share the verdict deliberately: the
    failure value may inhabit the declared type (`-> bool` returning `False`, a collapse that
    `_EMPTY` is too narrow to name) or fail to inhabit it (`-> dict` returning `None`, an annotation
    that is simply wrong). Both mean the same thing HERE — this mechanism cannot rule — and telling
