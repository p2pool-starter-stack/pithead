"""Two laws about what one failing poll step may cost: #1637 (cadence) and #1644 (siblings).

#1637 is the counter law below. #1644 is the sibling law: a raise in one step must not skip
unrelated steps beneath it for the rest of that poll. They meet in one place — the payout sync is
both the gated step whose cadence #1637 pins and the step #1644 isolates — which is why they are
tested together here rather than in two files that would each need the same 100-line harness.

`DataService.run()` counts polls in a plain local, `iteration_count`, and three steps are gated on
it with `iteration_count % 10 == 0`: the XvB stats sync, the Monero payout sync and the Tari payout
sync. The counter was incremented as the LAST statement of the `try` body, so any exception in that
body skipped it while the `except Exception` handler let the loop continue.

**The bug is a cadence inversion, not a lost count.** A frozen counter is frozen at a value that
already satisfies `% 10 == 0` — that is the only kind of poll on which a gated step can raise. So
the next poll re-runs the failing step, and the one after that: a step designed to run one poll in
ten retries a persistent failure on EVERY poll, at ten times its intended rate, never backing off.

That is why the assertions below count CALLS ACROSS POLLS rather than reading `iteration_count`.
The counter's value is an implementation detail of the throttle; the cadence is the behaviour the
issue is about, and a test that asserted `iteration_count == 1` would pass against a fix that
advanced the counter while leaving the gate wrong.

The fix is a `finally:`, not an increment at the top of the body. Incrementing first is not
equivalent: the counter starts at 0, `0 % 10 == 0` is true, so all three gated steps run on the
first poll by design — incrementing first would push their first run out to poll 10, a startup
regression this issue never asked for. `finally:` also survives the edit most likely to reintroduce
the bug, which is a `continue` being added to the loop body.

Lives in its own file rather than in `test_data_service.py`, which is at its recorded ceiling of
2538 lines with zero headroom. This file is deliberately under the 400-line target and carries no
`docs/dev/file-budget.tsv` row, because the gate fails a file that is under target AND has a row.
