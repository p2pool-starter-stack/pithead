"""#1556 — a module that has been annotated stays annotated.

`test_collapsed_return_channels.py` (#1487) enforces the rule that a failure path may not return a
value inhabiting the declared success type. That rule can only judge a function that DECLARES a
return type. An unannotated function is scored `blind`: not clean, not in breach, simply outside
what the mechanism can see. At the tip this file shipped against there were **52** such failure
returns across **31** modules, and #1556 is the work of annotating them slice by slice.

This file is the ratchet that makes each slice stick. Without it a slice is undone by any edit that
drops a `| None`, and nothing goes red: the collapse count does not move, and the #1487 laws have
nothing to say because they only speak about functions that made a promise.

**Where the function actually goes matters, and getting it wrong cost this file a round.** An edit
that DELETES the annotation returns the function to `blind`. An edit that merely drops the `| None`
does NOT — it leaves the function annotated, so `blind` never sees it, and its failure value is
outside `_EMPTY` so `collapse` never sees it either. Before #1556 gave that state the name
`unjudged`, such a function landed in no verdict list at all and a law phrased as "nothing here is
blind" was satisfied by it VANISHING. Both regressions are real and each has its own law below;
one law cannot cover both, because the second admits a read-and-signed exception and the first
admits none.

## Why this is a pin and not the baseline #1487 refused

#1487 refused to baseline the collapsed instances, and the reasoning stands: putting a `<= 11`
bound on them would certify whatever real defects they contain as intentional, on the strength of
nobody having read them. **This pin is the opposite case.** Every function inside a pinned module
was read as part of the slice that annotated it, and what is being asserted is that the reading
happened, not that the result is acceptable. The distinction is the same one `_SIGNED` draws in the
sibling file, moved up a level: a set someone signed, not a count nobody looked at.

So the pin is worded as **coverage**, never as a verdict. A pinned module may still hold a genuine
collapse — the gate will flag it, loudly, and this file will stay green while it does. What this
file refuses is the module going QUIET again.

## Why by module rather than by function

A per-function pin is a list of names that a rename breaks and a deletion silently shrinks — the
failure `_SIGNED`'s own docstring names. Pinning the module asserts something a rename cannot
disturb and a new function cannot slip past: **no failure return in this module is unannotated.**
Adding an unannotated one to a pinned module goes red, which is the point and is also the cost, and
it is a cost paid by exactly the modules someone has already done the work on.

`service/workers/worker_config_store.py` is pinned for a reason that predates #1556: it was fully annotated
already, and two of its three signed functions were pinned by `_SIGNED` while `note_worker_revision`
was not. That gap was in the tree at the base of this branch, not introduced by any slice.

## Where the data is

`PINNED` and `_ANCHORS` live in `tests/service/annotation_pins.py`, and `_UNJUDGED_AND_READ` in
`tests/service/annotation_readings.py`, each together with the comments that argue its entries.
They are the part of this mechanism that grows with every slice; what stayed here is what does not
— the three laws, their vacuity guards, and the controls that seed each shape across the boundary
a law decides on. Those modules' docstrings carry the reason for each split and the figures behind
it, and deliberately carry them ONLY there: a budget argument copied into another file is two
numbers to keep true, which is the failure this file's own header records twice.

    Every law above is a statement ABOUT a set, so each is satisfied by that set getting SMALLER.

    fail their cases, it DELETES them; the vacuity guard on `_UNJUDGED_AND_READ` asks only that the
    entries still THERE are real, and an entry that left is not there.

    **The three are not equally exposed, and #1614 over-generalises from `PINNED`.** Measured, one
    removal per structure, against a control-0 of 125 passed:

    - `PINNED` — dropping `web/views/xvb_views.py` reds this law and #1639's equality guard (2 failed,
      120 passed; the missing three are that module's own law-1, law-2 and walk-guard cases, which
      vanished with it rather than failing). This is the hole the issue describes, and it was real.
    - `_ANCHORS` — dropping the same module's entry ALSO reds
      `test_a_pinned_module_is_actually_in_the_walk[web/views/xvb_views.py]`, which subscripts `_ANCHORS`
      by a module still in `PINNED` and raises `KeyError` (3 failed, 122 passed).
    - `_UNJUDGED_AND_READ` — dropping `service/network/clearnet_sync.py:_write_marker` ALSO reds law 2 for
      that module, which stops excusing a function still scoring `unjudged` (2 failed, 123 passed).

    So on the two sibling structures this is defence in depth and not the sole catcher — **for the
    one-structure removal seeded above, and only there.** Retiring a module drops its `PINNED` and
    `_ANCHORS` rows TOGETHER: both sibling catches need the module still in `PINNED`, so their
    cases are DELETED rather than failed, `set(_ANCHORS) == set(PINNED)` still holds at 32 == 32,
    and these floors are the only assertions left. Measured on that seed: **2 failed, 120 passed,
    and both are floors.** They are kept for the sibling case too, because an incidental `KeyError`
    is a crash rather than a stated law and moves with any refactor of the guard raising it, and
    because law 2's catch is a side effect of what the entry MEANS, not of the set having a size.

    **One honest cost, on `_UNJUDGED_AND_READ` alone.** An entry whose function was properly
    annotated is a stale exception the vacuity guard already demands be removed, so that set has a
    LEGITIMATE way to shrink and this law reds on it. That is intended rather than a false pass:

    Law 1 says no FAILURE RETURN in a pinned module is unannotated. It has never said the module is
    annotated, and the difference is not academic: eighteen of the thirty-three hold functions that
    declare no return type and return a falsy value. Slice 12 emptied the `blind` set package-wide
    and moved that figure UP, which is the plainest statement of the gap there is. Those returns come through neither of the
    gate's two doors, so `classify` emits no row for them, and every law above is silent about them
    — correctly, because the mechanism genuinely cannot reach them.

    Nothing here rules on a single site. #1604 read none of them, and a count that grew a bound
    would be the baseline #1487 refused, wearing a third file's name. What is asserted is that the
    number exists and that the sweep producing it can tell one module from another."""
