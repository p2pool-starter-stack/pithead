"""#1556's pin data: which modules are pinned, and what anchors each one.

The read exceptions moved out at slice 12 and now live in `annotation_readings.py`, with the
reading for each entry beside it; that file's docstring carries the reason for the second split.

Nothing here is a test and nothing here asserts anything. The three laws and the vacuity guards
that read this data live in `test_annotation_coverage.py`, and so does the argument for the pin —
why it is coverage of a mechanism rather than a verdict, why it is by module rather than by
function, and why it is not the baseline #1487 refused. Read that file's module docstring first;
this one only holds what the laws run over.

## Why the data is a separate module

The pin grows by construction. Every slice of #1556 adds a row to `PINNED` and a row to
`_ANCHORS`, and a slice that reads an `unjudged` function adds an entry to the set that is now in
`annotation_readings.py`. Held in the test file, that growth ran straight into
`docs/dev/file-budget.tsv`, whose ceilings only ever go down: at slice 6 the file was 592 lines
against a recorded ceiling of 579, with 8 of 33 modules still unpinned. Raising the ceiling was
refused — 579 against a 400 target is already 1.45x, and `--generate` rewrites every row to the
actual count, so a hand-set high row does not survive the next regeneration. Compressing the file
would have deleted comments that are controls.

So the split is the third answer, and the rule it implements is: the part that grows is not the
part that is budgeted. This module is under the 400-line target and therefore records no ceiling
at all. If it ever crosses 400 that is the moment to re-read the split, not to raise a number.

That moment arrived at slice 12, which is what `annotation_readings.py` is. This file stood at
exactly 400 lines and slice 12 owed two more readings than would fit, so the sentence above was
honoured rather than argued with: the read exceptions left with their readings, and no row was
added to `docs/dev/file-budget.tsv`. The split was cut between two datasets and never between an
entry and its argument, which is the constraint the paragraph below states.

The cost was priced and accepted: the data now sits one file away from the laws that read it. The
argument for each entry travels WITH the entry — the comments below moved here from the test file
along with the values they explain, and the read exceptions moved on again at slice 12 with theirs
— so the split is between data and laws, never between an entry and its justification. Of that
FIRST move, three sentences changed and only three: two that said
"wearing this file's name" while meaning the pin's, and one that pointed at a test class as
"below" when it is now in the sibling file.

## The name keeps its leading underscore

`_ANCHORS` is imported by name, which is what a leading underscore usually argues against. It
keeps it because the underscore states the real scope: it exists for
`test_annotation_coverage.py`'s vacuity guard, and nothing else may read it. The same reasoning
kept `_UNJUDGED_AND_READ`'s underscore when that set moved to `annotation_readings.py`, and there
it is load-bearing rather than tidy — two docstrings in the test file quote that name while
arguing why law 2 is shaped as it is, so a rename would falsify prose in the same commit that
moved the data, which is the failure the pin comment below records happening twice already.
"""

# The modules with ZERO unannotated failure returns, measured over live source. Each slice of #1556
# adds the module it finished, and a module holding more than one is pinned only once EVERY one of
# its failure returns has been annotated and read. Which slice took which module is in #1556 and in
# git, not here. Measured at this tip: **33 of the 33 modules that hold a failure return at all**,
# and **`blind` is EMPTY package-wide**. Slice 12 took the last two, both in
# `service/network/clearnet_sync.py` and both through the `except` door — the handle-guard population
# closed at slice 8. That last clause is a measurement and not a reading the walk could not
# contradict: `guard` is a door the walk still reports 31 times package-wide.
#
# A pinned set covering every module that holds a failure return is NOT a fully annotated package,
# and with `blind` empty the two are easy to read as one. What closed is scoped to the gate's two
# doors. Falsy returns from functions declaring no return type sit outside both, inside pinned
# modules, in a number `TestTheResidueThePinCannotRuleOn` prints — deliberately not copied here,
# because a slice falsifies a copy while the printer cannot go stale.
#
# Every figure above is re-derived at the head being shipped, never carried across a slice: 5b moved
# this tuple from 18 to 21 and left the sentence beside it saying 18. A slice adds rows to a tuple
# and the counting prose next to it is falsified in the same commit, silently, and no gate in this
# repo can see it — re-derive it here rather than carrying it. Slice 7 found two more of exactly
# that kind already standing below, one of them spelled in WORDS, where a digit-keyed sweep misses.
#
# The `client/` scoping below applies to `tor_heal.py` too, measured: `decide` holds four
# unannotated `None` returns and `check` two bare ones, all six OUTSIDE the gate's two doors —
# pinned, law 1 honestly green, and NOT "fully annotated".
#
# That sentence was true and, until #1604, the ONLY one of its kind here — eight other pinned
# modules held the same residue, named nowhere but inside the tuple below, so a reader who found
# `tor_heal.py`'s disclosure could reasonably infer the rest were clean. An asymmetric disclosure is
# worse than a uniform absence: the silence beside the others reads as a statement. The residue is
# now MEASURED for every pinned module and printed by `TestTheResidueThePinCannotRuleOn` — a module
# joining `PINNED` gets a line whether anyone writes a sentence or not, and cannot go asymmetric.
#
# Slice 7 is `service/storage_service.py`, the first slice carried by the HANDLE GUARD rather than
# the `except` door: nine of its ten come through the guard, and `_prune_quarantined` is the one
# handler. Ten, not the nine a guard-door count gives — that miscount was in the handoff this
# slice started from, and pinning the module needs all ten. All ten are the same shape and were
# read as one only after each was confirmed to BE that shape: the guard's whole body is a bare
# `return`, and the function returns no value on any path. That was measured, not eyeballed —
# zero valued returns and zero yields across all ten, with
# a positive control (`get_kv`, which has three valued returns) to show the walk could see one.
#
# So every one is a genuine `-> None` procedure, and the slice adds ZERO to `signed` and ten to
# `procedure`. That is the whole outcome and it is stated plainly rather than dressed up: what this
# module's pin asserts is that #1487's rule structurally CANNOT apply to these ten — a procedure has
# no success value for a failure to hide inside — and that this is now SAID rather than silent,
# which is exactly what #1581 added the sixth verdict for. Law 2 is NOT vacuous here despite the
# module holding no `unjudged` row: re-signing one of them `-> bool` sends its bare `return` to
# `unjudged`, and law 2 reds. That was seeded and confirmed, because a law nobody fired is a law
# nobody has evidence for.
#
# The module's `collapse` rows and its residue are untouched by this slice and stay flagged.
#
# The reading is also what found **#1615**: `add_block` and `add_worker_history` stamp the per-table
# write-health signal, and the guard returns BEFORE either stamp — so after a failed corruption
# recovery every telemetry table REPORTED `healthy: True` while its writes were dropped. Filed
# rather than fixed here: this slice is annotation-only and proven bytecode-identical. #1615 then
# fixed it at the READ rather than by stamping the five guards — `get_table_health` derives
# `healthy` from the handle — so every guard below is untouched and that proof still stands.
#
# Slice 8 is `service/telemetry_store.py`, and it is slice 7's shape with nothing new to argue: its
# three writers are the same closed-handle guard whose whole body is a bare `return`, measured the
# same way (zero valued returns, zero yields, with `get_xvb_history`'s three valued returns as the
# control that the walk can see one). Three more `procedure` rows, ZERO to `signed`. It closes the
# HANDLE-GUARD population — at slice 8's own head every one of the twelve failure returns still
# blind came through the `except` door, a figure left scoped to that head rather than updated in
# place. A past-tense sentence cannot be falsified by a LATER slice, but it can still be wrong at
# the head it describes: slice 9 found exactly that in the sibling test file, where "the twelve
# that score zero" had drifted to thirteen unnoticed. Scoping a figure to its head protects it
# from the future, not from the measurement.
#
# One thing here is worth carrying: this module's residue and its blind set were the SAME THREE
# SITES. The gate saw them through the guard door, and #1604's sweep saw them as falsy returns from
# functions declaring nothing — two instruments answering different questions about one site. So
# annotating cleared both at once, and the module now reports **0 residue sites**. That zero is a
# disclosure, not an absence: it is printed because the module is pinned, which is the whole of why
# #1604 prints the clean modules too.
#
# That overlap is NOT unique and the first draft of this comment said it was, unmeasured. Measured
# at this tip: `helper/utils.py` had the same shape — 2 residue functions and the same 2 blind —
# and slice 9 took it, so that prediction is DISCHARGED rather than left standing: re-measured at
# slice 9's head, the module reports 0 residue sites.
#
# The sentence that stood here — "in every other module the two sets are DISJOINT", carrying
# `storage_service.py`'s `add_shares`/`save_snapshot` as its evidence — is RETRACTED. It was true
# of the module it named and false as the generalisation it read as, because the two halves were
# measured over DIFFERENT POPULATIONS: in a PINNED module `blind` is empty by construction, so
# "disjoint" is vacuous there rather than a finding, and every module it implicitly quantified over
# was pinned. Re-measured at slice 9's head over the five modules that still hold a blind return,
# the sets are disjoint in NOT ONE of them — `blind` is a SUBSET of the residue in all five, and in
# `web/server.py` they are the SAME SET (`_finalize_worker_upgrade` and `_num`), a THIRD module of
# the shape this paragraph first called unique and then called doubled. The mechanism is that a
# blind function is unannotated by definition, so a falsy failure return lands it in both
# instruments at once; only a blind function returning a NON-falsy value can separate them, which
# is why the coincidence is the common case and not the exception. **Do not infer one set from the
# other — but do not infer independence either: they answer different questions, they coincide far
# more often than this file used to say, and which way they fall depends on whether the module has
# been pinned yet.**
#
# Slice 9 is `helper/utils.py`, and slices 7 and 8 transfer NOTHING to it beyond the method. The
# discriminator is NOT the door — slice 7's `_prune_quarantined` came through the `except` door
# too — it is that those thirteen were all bare-`return` procedures, measured at zero valued
# returns and zero yields, where `-> None` is simply honest. BOTH of these return a VALUE, so
# each had to be read on its own terms and they landed in DIFFERENT verdicts. That split is the point of the slice: one `signed`, one `unjudged`, ZERO
# `procedure`. `helper/utils.py` is the SECOND module to hold both verdicts at once, not the first
# — `service/workers/worker_config_store.py` already did. That was measured here rather than asserted,
# because the first draft of this sentence said "first" and the measurement refuted it.
#
#   `detect_host_ipv4` -> `str | None` is a true `signed`, and the annotation invents nothing: the
#     docstring ALREADY declared the contract in prose — "Returns ``None`` when it can't be
#     determined (e.g. no default route), so callers fall back to showing the hostname alone" — and
#     its sole production caller, `web/views/views.py:host_display_addr`, acts on exactly that. `None` is
#     the out-of-band answer, distinguishable from every success value, which is what `signed`
#     means. The annotation moves a promise the code already kept into the signature.
#
# `is_ip_address` is the `unjudged` one and its reading is filed with its entry in
# `annotation_readings.py` rather than here, so that the argument travels WITH the value the way
# every entry in both files does.
#
# Both functions were proven bytecode-identical base-vs-head, with a seeded `return True` ->
# `return False` inside `is_ip_address` as the positive control: it flipped that function and ONLY
# that function, which is what makes the clean reading on the other two evidence rather than an
# empty result.
#
# Slice 10 is `web/server.py`, and it repeats slice 9's lesson rather than slice 7/8's: two blind
# functions, both through the `except` door, landing in DIFFERENT verdicts again — one `procedure`,
# one `signed`, ZERO `unjudged`, so no `_UNJUDGED_AND_READ` entry is owed. Two slices running now, a
# module's blind pair has not shared a verdict; do not expect the next one to.
#
#   `_finalize_worker_upgrade` -> `-> None` is a genuine procedure, measured the way slices 7 and 8
#     measured theirs: ONE return, ZERO valued, ZERO yields, with `handle_control_preview`'s three
#     valued returns as the control that the walk can see one. It is #1014's background half — it
#     records the terminal outcome of a worker upgrade and answers nobody — so its `except` return
#     is a bare `return` after `logger.exception`, with no success value to hide inside.
#
#   `_num` -> `-> float | None` is a true `signed`, and like `detect_host_ipv4` the annotation moves
#     a promise the code already kept into the signature. All three returns are valued and every one
#     is a float or `None`: an absent/empty param, the `ValueError` from `float()`, and
#     `f if math.isfinite(f) else None` because `float()` parses "inf"/"nan". Its docstring already
#     said so in prose — "anything non-numeric reads as absent" — and the consumer agrees, read
#     rather than assumed: `_log_filters`' two callers hand the pair straight to
#     `audit_service.filter_log_entries`, whose docstring says `None` means "don't filter on this
#     axis". `None` is out-of-band there, distinguishable from every float bound.
#
# The anchor is `_finalize_worker_upgrade`: declared first, and top-level where `_num` is a nested
# closure — lifting or inlining it would drop its row for a reason that is not a walk failure. What
# is NOT a reason, measured before choosing rather than argued after: the nested-def regression
# (`_own_nodes` degraded to `ast.walk`) ADDS a `_log_filters` row rather than removing one, so
# NEITHER candidate fires on it. Neither is double-guarded either, this module contributing no
# `_UNJUDGED_AND_READ` entry, so law 1's aggregate and this anchor are the whole of its cover.
#
# One thing slice 10 has that slices 1-9 did not, and it narrows what the proof claims. Annotating
# a NESTED def is not free at the bytecode level: both annotated functions ARE bytecode-identical
# base-vs-head, but the enclosing `_log_filters` is NOT — its whole delta is the annotation built at
# def time, read instruction by instruction, and that is correct rather than a defect. A FUNCTION
# scope is the only one that rebuilds an annotation per call; a method's is built once in the class
# body at import. Re-measured at this tip keyed by NODE, with a control that the walk can report a
# nested def at all: both blind functions left are class methods, so nothing remaining inherits
# this. Nothing is claimed about a nested def some future slice might introduce.
#
# The module's residue went 3 sites in 2 functions to ZERO, DISCHARGING the prediction slice 9's
# retraction left standing above: it named `web/server.py` as the module where `blind` and the
# residue are the SAME SET, and annotating the pair cleared both instruments at once.
#
# Slice 11 takes `alert_service.py`, `control_service.py` and `telegram_commands.py` under
# `service/` together, because not one of them owes an `_UNJUDGED_AND_READ` entry. Every verdict was
# READ off `classify` after annotating, never predicted: `process` and `_load_core_keys` ->
# `collapse` (each returns `[]` where the success value is a list — the defect #1556 documents, not
# one a slice fixes); `maybe_daily_summary`, `result`, `_safe_reply_for` -> `signed`;
# `_dispatch_control` -> `procedure` (ONE return, bare, in the handler). No pair shared a verdict.
# `_dispatch_control` and `pause_for_host_approval` were deleted with the Telegram write surface
# (#2076); the module's anchor moved to `_safe_reply_for`, one of the rows slice 11 already
# read as `signed`, so the pin still names a row this walk actually produces.
#
# Three `signed` rows are weaker than the word — one here, two from earlier slices, recorded
# together because disclosing only the new one is what #1604 was. `classify` reads `signed` off the
# FAILURE returns ALONE and cannot see a SUCCESS return that is a CALL producing the same marker.
# Measured over all 31: `_safe_reply_for` (`reply_for` answers `None` on 3 of its 15 returns),
# `client/xvb_client.py:get_stats` (`_parse_html`, 2), `service/xvb/price_feed.py:fetch`
# (`parse_prices`, 2). Each type is the true one and stays; that a caller can tell the failure from
# the quiet success is NOT claimed — seeing that needs the callee's returns, a whole-package
# inference this walk deliberately does not make.
#
# #1628 RE-DERIVED that population and CONFIRMED it at three, by a different route rather than by
# re-reading this paragraph. The figures above resolved the callee BY NAME across the package,
# which #1628 says is approximate in both directions and had already produced one false positive
# removed by hand (`control_service.py:result` calling stdlib `json.load`, matched against
# `storage_service.py:load`). The re-derivation binds instead — `self.X` to the enclosing class,
# a bare name to module defs then that module's imports, a dotted name to an in-package module —
# and reports anything it cannot bind rather than scoring it clean. Same three rows, same counts,
# and `result` falls out MECHANICALLY into the unresolved bucket, which holds five rows in all —
# `result`'s `json.load`, `float` twice, `json.loads`, and a chained `datetime` call. Shown able to answer
# otherwise, both ways, against the real package: de-noning `parse_prices` drops `fetch` to two
# rows, and giving `mask_secrets` one `None` return moves `_read_host_config` from clean to flagged
# at four. The instrument is NOT shipped — resolving callees is the inference #1487's ruling
# governs, and #1628's own ruling was to leave `classify` alone.
#
# `_safe_reply_for`'s collapse is DELIBERATE, which is #1628's first question answered: its caller
# does `if reply:` and sends nothing either way, so a handler that raised and a message that was
# not a command are the same event downstream, and the docstring's "a broken command just goes
# quiet" is the intent rather than an oversight. That sentence belongs beside the code and is here
# instead: `telegram_commands.py` stands at 1023 lines against a recorded ceiling of 1023, and
# paying for a comment by compressing production code is worse than the gap it documents.
#
# Slice 4 added ZERO to `signed`, which is the CORRECT outcome and was predicted before it was
# written: `config/` holds one collapse (`load_worker_endpoints` returning `[]`) and one residual
# (`local_miner_enabled` returning `False`). A slice is coverage of the mechanism, so a slice whose
# two functions both decline to be signable has done its whole job.
#
# Slice 2 wrote here that "no module under `client/` holds an unannotated failure return any more".
# That is TRUE under `_failure_returns`' definition and it READS as "`client/` is done, never look
# here again". It is not. The gate sees exactly two doors — a `return` lexically inside an `except`
# handler, and a return that is the whole body of a `self._conn` guard — and **14 unannotated
# functions under `client/` hold collapse-shaped returns outside both of them**, measured.
# `client/monero/monero_wallet_client.py:get_confirmed_payouts` is a genuine failure path among
# them: it returns `[]` when `_rpc` returned `None`, which no caller can tell from "no payouts".
# So the claim is scoped to the instrument that makes it — no unannotated failure return **that
# this gate can see**. A pin is coverage of a mechanism, never a certificate about a package.
#
# Slice 12 is `service/network/clearnet_sync.py`, and it is the LAST one. At its head `classify` returns an
# EMPTY `blind` list over the whole package, which is the state #1556 was opened to reach: every
# failure return the gate's two doors can see now declares a type. Its two functions are
# `_marker_exists` and `_write_marker` — both class methods, both through the `except` door, both
# returning `False` — and both were MEASURED into `unjudged` after annotating rather than predicted
# into it. That makes this the first slice since 9 to owe a written reading and the first ever to
# owe two; both are in `annotation_readings.py` beside their entries.
#
# It is also the first slice whose blind pair SHARES a verdict. Slices 9, 10 and 11 each split
# across two, and the note above saying not to expect a shared one was right for them; it stops
# being a rule here. What makes this pair share is that neither reaches `signed` — not that either
# was signed — so nothing about the earlier reasoning is overturned by it.
#
# The anchor is `_write_marker`, and this is the first module where the standing rule could NOT be
# followed. "Anchor where the other guard is not" is unsatisfiable here: `_rows_under` finds exactly
# TWO rows for this module and both are `unjudged`, so whichever one is named is already held alive
# by `_UNJUDGED_AND_READ`'s own vacuity guard, and the anchor guards it a second time. That is
# measured, not assumed — `maybe_transition` returns `False` twice but through NEITHER door, so the
# walk emits no row for it and it cannot serve as the anchor. Of the two that can, `_write_marker`
# is the one whose silent exit from the walk would cost most, on the ground `add_block` was chosen
# for `storage_service.py`: the class's fail-safe turns on it, since the marker must be on disk
# before any restart.
#
# What slice 12 does NOT do is make law 1 a statement about the package. Law 1 quantifies over
# `PINNED`, so a NEW module arriving with an unannotated failure return is outside it, and an empty
# `blind` list does not change that. The gap is closed in the sibling file rather than here:
# `test_collapsed_return_channels.py`'s blind-spot measurement was written to red the day this set
# emptied — "if it collapses to zero the package became fully annotated and the gate's reach grew —
# both worth a deliberate look" — and slice 12 is that day. It now asserts the EMPTY set instead of
# the non-empty one, which is a law over the whole package that no per-module pin can be.
#
# **Only ever add a module you have read.** Adding one because the gate happens to score it clean
# is the baseline #1487 refused, wearing the pin's name.

# One function per pinned module, as the vacuity anchor. Law 1's own guard uses this shape: a
# statement about "no blind names under this prefix" is satisfied perfectly by a module that has
# vanished from the walk, and that is the reading a deleted file, a moved package root or a broken
# `rglob` all produce. `note_worker_revision` is the deliberate choice for its module — it is the
# one signed function `_SIGNED` never named. `add_block` is the choice for

# still score `unjudged`.
# Anchoring here on `is_ip_address` would guard one function twice and leave the `signed` one
# guarded by nothing but law 1's aggregate — which a vanished module satisfies perfectly. The
