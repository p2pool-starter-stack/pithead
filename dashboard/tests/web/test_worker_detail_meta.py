"""Config provenance in the Inspect payload (#1345): ``rig_config_meta`` and ``config_origin``.

The question this answers is the one an operator asks when the rig disagrees with their own record
— *did this change come from here, or did something change it underneath me?* Answering it needs
one fact only this side holds: whether the rig's ``last_change_id`` matches a change THIS dashboard
spooled. The rig mints those ids and hands them back in the 202, so an id we have a ``worker_config``
row for is an id we asked for.

New file: ``test_views.py`` is at its file-budget ceiling.

Mutation-kill notes, one per guard — each of these was run and seen to red:
- Returning ``"here"`` unconditionally for ``source == "control"`` (dropping the id comparison)
  flips ``test_control_change_we_never_spooled_is_elsewhere`` — which is the whole feature.
- Folding ``restore`` into ``rig`` flips ``test_restore_is_its_own_verdict_not_a_rig_edit``; that
  fold would tell the operator a person touched the rig when RigForge merely rolled itself back.
- Making an absent block report ``"unrecorded"`` instead of ``None`` flips
  ``test_a_rig_that_cannot_answer_says_nothing``: silence and "we have no record of a change" are
  different claims, and only one of them is true of a rig too old to serve the block.
- Passing the rig's ``source`` through instead of matching the allowlist flips
  ``test_a_source_we_do_not_know_never_reaches_the_verdict``.
- Swapping the worker-scoped history scan back to ``state_mgr.worker_config_change_known`` — which
  is unscoped and fails OPEN, both correct for the #530 audit and both wrong here — flips
  ``test_another_rigs_change_id_is_never_claimed_as_this_rigs`` and
  ``test_a_history_read_that_fails_never_manufactures_trust``.

        A config file edited underneath RigForge is not a *recorded* change, so the marker keeps
        naming whatever came before it. Where that was our own control change, the line says "Last
        changed from this dashboard" over a config we did not set — the one direction the rest of
        this feature exists to avoid. RigForge computes the value that would catch it (the marker's
        stored revision) and then overwrites it with the live one before serving, so the comparison
        needs the last revision we OBSERVED, which is persistence this does not add.

        When #1367 closes, this test SHOULD red. Update it then — do not delete it.
