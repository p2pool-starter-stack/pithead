"""What the wizard server publishes as an unconfigured machine's starting point (#1830).

A sibling of ``test_wizard.py`` rather than more rows inside it: that file sits at its recorded
ceiling in ``docs/dev/file-budget.tsv``, and ceilings only go down. Its ``spool``/``client``
fixtures are module-local, so this module carries its own copies.

The half the operator SEES — the role select reading these back — is pinned where the dashboard
tests its frontend: ``node --test`` over ``tests/frontend/wizardrole.test.mjs``.
