"""No pool credential leaves the Worker Inspect payload, in ANY of the fields that carry a
``worker_config`` row's ``changes`` (#1543).

The issue this closes named ``last_applied``, and that field really did serve the password. It was
not the only one: ``build_worker_detail`` publishes the same rows' ``changes`` THREE times --
``last_applied`` (the merge), ``history`` (the rendered table), and
``hashrate_history.markers[]`` (the chart tooltips, #1015). A fix at
``get_last_applied_worker_config`` would have cleaned the field the issue named and left the other
two serving the credential, with nothing going red.

So the load-bearing assertion here is deliberately NOT a per-field one:
``test_no_credential_anywhere_in_the_serialized_payload`` scans the whole rendered payload, which
is the only form of the check that does not depend on my having enumerated the fields correctly.
The per-field tests are underneath it to say WHERE, so a future regression names itself.

Every test seeds the row the way a build before the fix wrote it -- the credential in the stored
JSON, inserted around the store's own writer, since that writer now strips.
``test_the_seed_really_carries_the_credential`` is the control that the seed armed.
