"""Run-from-USB narration: a rig set up to RUN FROM the stick is never shown the installer's
"Copying the system to the disk…" (#1835).

Nothing is copied to any disk on that path — the rig is provisioned in place and starts mining
— so both things the page can read must agree: /status and the stage the frontend polls. A
sibling assertion pins the DISK-install path in every case, because a fix that merely deleted
the install narration would pass a one-sided test while breaking the path that needs it.

A new file rather than rows in test_wizard.py: that file is at its file-budget ceiling.
