"""Local vs remote for the Monero and Tari nodes (#1040).

The two nodes an operator can run either on this machine or somebody else's. A remote node's
health is not theirs to fix, so the dashboard has to say which it is looking at — the diagram and
both node cards read it from ``/api/state``'s ``sync`` block, the only per-node block that covers
BOTH chains (``state.monero`` has no Tari twin).

New file: test_views.py is at its file-budget ceiling.
