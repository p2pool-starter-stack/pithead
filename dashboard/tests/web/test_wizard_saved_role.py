"""The set-up-again screen's server half (#1318).

A boot with `pithead.setup=1` publishes one extra spool file, `saved-role.json`, naming the role
this machine is already set up as. Its PRESENCE is the whole signal: the page offers "Keep it"
only when the host said what there is to keep. These tests pin that reading and the one write
the Keep half makes.

They live beside `test_wizard.py` rather than in it because that file is at its budget ceiling.
