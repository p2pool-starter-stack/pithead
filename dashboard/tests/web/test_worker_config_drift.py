"""Value-level config drift for Worker Inspect (#1367).

``config_origin`` (#1345) reports the last change RigForge *recorded*. A config edited underneath
RigForge records nothing, so on a rig where this dashboard applied the previous change the line
keeps reading "Last changed from this dashboard" while the rig runs something else — a false
reassurance, the one direction that feature exists to avoid. ``config_drift`` catches that by
comparing the two values already in the payload.

The bulk of what is tested here is the TYPE discipline, because that is where a value comparison
re-opens the very false-positive the issue rejects the revision-hash fix for. RigForge fixes the
JSON type of every writable scalar as it serves it; nothing on this side coerces anything, and four
reachable editor paths store a string where the rig serves a number. Comparing those raw reports
drift on a rig running exactly what we applied.
