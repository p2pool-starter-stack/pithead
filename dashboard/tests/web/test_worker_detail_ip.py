"""Click-to-adopt (#893): ``build_worker_detail``'s ``ip`` field is the adopt-form's PREFILL
source. It must be the miner-observed address (never the operator-confirmed ``host`` already in
config.json, once adopted) — that distinction IS the trust model: a prefill can be wrong or
adversarial, an ``editable`` host cannot. New file (test_views.py is at its file-budget ceiling).

Mutation-kill notes: swapping ``worker.get("ip")`` for the descriptor's ``host`` (or dropping the
``if worker else None`` guard so a not-found worker crashes or fabricates a value) would flip
``test_ip_is_the_observed_value_even_when_a_different_host_is_configured`` /
``test_ip_is_none_when_worker_not_in_snapshot``.
