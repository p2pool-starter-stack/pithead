"""The #1233 refresh trigger, end to end through the real ``/api/control/worker-upgrade`` route and
its background finalizer (mirrors ``test_server.py``'s ``TestWorkerUpgradeRecordsHistory`` fixture
shape, since ``worker_refresh`` is exercised from the SAME background task that records history).

Each test names the mutation it would catch:
  - deleting the ``maybe_refresh_after_upgrade`` call in ``_finalize_worker_upgrade`` (or any
    guard that made it unreachable) would leave the refresh mock uncalled on a genuine success —
    ``test_applied_result_triggers_refresh`` / ``test_accepted_result_triggers_refresh`` catch that.
  - inverting the success/non-success split would fire it on a rejection or skip a real success —
    the paired non-firing tests below catch either direction.
  - passing the wrong worker/version (e.g. the client's stale proposal instead of the host's
    re-derived tag) would still pass a "was it called" test but fail the exact-args assertion.
