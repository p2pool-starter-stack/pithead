"""Click-to-adopt (#893) at the route level: ``handle_control_preview`` — the SAME endpoint every
other config edit uses, no new write route — pre-validates a proposal's newly-appended
``workers.list[]`` entries before it ever spools to the host-side runner.

This is the dashboard's own defense-in-depth mirror of pithead's ``control_approval_gate`` add-only
exception (the actual security authority, exercised at commit); these tests prove the mirror is
WIRED IN to the real request handler, not just correct in isolation (that's
``tests/service/workers/test_worker_adopt.py``). Each rejection test would pass right through (200/202,
request spooled) if the guard call in ``handle_control_preview`` were removed or its condition
inverted — that is the mutation each one kills.
