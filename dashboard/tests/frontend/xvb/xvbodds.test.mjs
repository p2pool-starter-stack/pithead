// #1231: what the XvB decision table's "Odds / 30d" cell says when there is no odds figure yet.
//
// A bare "—" there was indistinguishable from a measured zero. The column is filled from XvB's
// public winners feed, and the sync that fills the round-stats cache is ENABLE_XVB-gated
// (build_xvb_calc), so there are exactly two empty states and the payload already separates
// them: XvB never enabled (nothing will ever arrive until it is), and XvB on but not yet synced.
// The cell names which one it is.
//
// A new file rather than more of xvbview.test.mjs: that file sits at its recorded file-budget
// ceiling (431), and this gate's ceilings only ever go down.
//
// Run with Node's built-in test runner (CI runs exactly this):
//     node --test dashboard/tests/frontend/
