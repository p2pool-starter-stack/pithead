// Unit tests for the rig handoff card's contents (issue #1836):
// mining_dashboard/web/static/workers/rigcardlogic.mjs — which rows the card shows, and the note that
// replaced "no login — nothing to save" now that there is a token to save.
//
// Run with Node's built-in test runner (CI runs exactly this):
//     node --test dashboard/tests/frontend/
//
// Mutation-kill notes: the two "missing" cases are the point of the module. Dropping either guard
// in rigCardFields puts a labelled row with a blank value on the card, which the row-count and
// label assertions catch; dropping either branch in rigCardNote leaves the operator being told to
// paste something that does not exist, which the phrase assertions catch in both directions — each
// case asserts what its note MUST say and what it must NOT.
