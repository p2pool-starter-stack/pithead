// xvbview.mjs carried a `const StatCard` byte-identical to the export above, justified in-file by
// a `workerview.mjs` InfoCard precedent that did not apply. Nothing caught it and nothing here
// could have: identical copies render identically, so no assertion over rendered output can tell
// them apart — which is why this law is enforced over the SOURCE. It proves the text (no sibling
// module re-declares one of these names) and NOT the behaviour (it cannot tell you a caller
// actually uses the import it holds). The names are read out of statcards.mjs itself, so a
// primitive added there is covered without editing this test.
