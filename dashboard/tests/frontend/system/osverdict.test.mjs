// The post-reboot OS-update verdict sentence (#1051) and the blocking-cause clause #1265 adds.
//
// The host makes every judgment; these tests only check that its verdict becomes honest display
// text. The case that matters most is the one with nothing to render: an appliance on an OS image
// older than #1671 sends no `blocking` at all, and the sentence must read exactly as it always
// did rather than growing a dangling clause or implying a cause nobody reported.
//
// Escaping is deliberately NOT asserted here. Preact escapes text interpolations in the browser,
// but tests/frontend/helpers/render.mjs is a render probe that does not escape, so an assertion
// made through it would pass or fail for a reason unrelated to the thing it names. What this file
// does hold is the sanitizer's own contract: shape, type, and a bounded length.
//
// Run with Node's built-in test runner:
//     node --test dashboard/tests/frontend/*.test.mjs
