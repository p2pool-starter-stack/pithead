// Unit tests for mining_dashboard/web/static/config/confighistory.mjs — the change-history vocabulary
// (STATUS_META, HistoryRow) split out of workerview.mjs, plus the config-provenance line (#1345).
//
// New file: workerview.test.mjs is at its file-budget ceiling. Rendering uses the dependency-free
// vnode walker (helpers/render.mjs) — no DOM, no npm deps. Run with: node --test dashboard/tests/frontend/
//
// The line under test is the one place a rig's own account of itself reaches the operator's screen,
// so the assertions are about what it may and may not CLAIM, not about markup:
//   - silence when the rig cannot answer (never the word "unknown");
//   - "restored" never phrased as someone having edited the rig;
//   - "unrecorded" never phrased as a change having happened;
//   - "unconfirmed" phrased as neither of its neighbours — it may not read as the change having
//     held, and it may not state the rollback it has no record of either.
