// The failed-apply wording an appliance operator reads (#1769).
//
// The defect: the host puts `tail -c 2000` of the raw `apply` log into the control result's
// `error` field, server.py returns that dict to the browser unfiltered, and the Configuration
// card rendered the tail bare beneath a sentence naming a host filesystem path. An appliance has
// no shell, so both the path and the log's imperatives are dead ends. #1213 settled the rule for
// doctor's messages; this is the same rule on a surface #1213's dr_* sweep is structurally blind
// to, because the text never passes through dr_*.
//
// Its own file rather than more of configview.test.mjs: that file is at its recorded budget
// ceiling with no headroom, and this is a distinct defect class. It reuses the sibling render
// probe (helpers/render.mjs) rather than duplicating one.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT COVER, so nobody reads it as more than it is:
//   - The App -> ConfigView prop hop (`appliance=${!!state.os_update}`, components.mjs:1044) is
//     verified by reading, not by a test: ConfigView's first paint through App is always its
//     loading card, so this render probe cannot reach the failed state that way. The test below
//     that pins the undefined-prop degradation is what stands in for it.
//   - Escaping. The probe does not escape, so an assertion about it would pass or fail for a
//     reason unrelated to what it names (the same call osverdict.test.mjs makes).
//   - That no CLI verb reaches an appliance at all. That is FALSE by design and asserted false
//     below: the log tail is kept verbatim on both branches, because it is real diagnostic detail
//     and #1769 is a wording problem, not a redaction one.
//
// Run with Node's built-in test runner (CI runs exactly this):
//     node --test dashboard/tests/frontend/*.test.mjs
