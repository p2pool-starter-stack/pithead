"""
Closed-loop tests for the production XvB donation controller (Issues #9, #70).

The single-step tests in tests/service/xvb/test_algo_service_*.py can't see how the
controller behaves over time: the calibration loop only converges as the
controller's own donations feed back through XvB's windowed averages across many
cycles. These drive the `mining_dashboard.sim` harness — which wraps the real
`AlgoService` — across simulated days and assert on the loop: that it holds the
tier at minimum waste regardless of how XvB scales the donation, never winds up,
keeps p2pool "VIP", and recovers from disturbances.
