# A payout is "confirmed" the moment it is mined into a block (mined_in_block_height > 0), NOT when
# the coinbase matures — mirrors #381's Monero rule so a payout is recorded/alerted exactly once.
# The direction/status gate is generous on purpose: p2pool's Tari coinbase is a one-sided output to
# wallet_payment_address, and which enum a view-only wallet reports it under
# (COINBASE_CONFIRMED vs ONE_SIDED_CONFIRMED vs a plain INBOUND) is the one item pinned to tier-4
# (the live bench). Keeping the accept-set here isolated means tightening it after that check is a one-line
# change. Enum values are the wallet.proto constants (TransactionStatus / TransactionDirection).

class TariWalletClient:
    """
    Reads confirmed incoming payouts from a view-only ``minotari_console_wallet`` (#462).

    The Tari sibling of :class:`MoneroWalletClient` (#381). The stack runs a view-only console
    wallet — created from the operator's PRIVATE VIEW KEY + PUBLIC SPEND KEY — against the LOCAL
    Tari node; it can SCAN but never spend. This client streams ``GetCompletedTransactions`` on a
    slow cadence to confirm a Tari merge-mine coinbase actually landed (solo merge-mining pays the
    whole block reward at once, ~72 days apart at prod hashrate, so a confirmed payout is a rare,
    large event worth an alert).

    Async (grpc.aio), mirroring :class:`TariClient`; the wallet gRPC is unauthenticated (insecure
    channel), same as the base node. Every failure mode returns ``[]`` so a wallet still doing its
    first-run scan (or briefly unreachable) degrades the feature quietly rather than raising.

    ``get_confirmed_payouts`` delegates the scan to ``_scan_completed_transactions``; if tier-4
    shows the coinbase surfaces only via ``GetBalance``/``GetUnspentAmounts`` and not the completed-
    transactions stream, swapping the scan source is a one-method change here.
