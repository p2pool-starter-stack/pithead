class MoneroWalletClient:

    Reads confirmed incoming payouts from a view-only ``monero-wallet-rpc`` (#381).

    The stack runs monero-wallet-rpc generated from the operator's PRIVATE VIEW KEY (empty spend
    key) against the LOCAL monerod — it can SCAN but never spend. This client polls
    ``get_transfers {"in": true}`` on a slow cadence to confirm that P2Pool coinbase payouts
    actually landed in the wallet, the only ground truth (the earnings figure elsewhere is an
    estimate).

    monero-wallet-rpc runs with ``--rpc-login``, so calls use HTTP digest auth. Synchronous
    (requests + HTTPDigestAuth); the async data loop calls it via ``asyncio.to_thread``, mirroring
    :class:`MoneroClient`. Every failure mode returns ``None`` / ``[]`` so a wallet still doing its
    first-run scan (or briefly unreachable) degrades the feature quietly rather than raising.
