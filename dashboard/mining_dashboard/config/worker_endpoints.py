# Split out of config.py to keep it under its file-budget ceiling (#1285). Unlike the rest of
# config.py's flat environment settings, these two loaders parse the read-only config.json bind

# --- Per-worker endpoint descriptors (#172, config.json: workers.list[]) ---
# [{name, host?, port?, token?}] — per-rig overrides for the worker API probe when a rig doesn't
# match the fleet defaults (different port, API on another interface/NAT hop, its own token).
# Read from the read-only config.json bind mount above, NOT the .env render: entries carry
# per-worker API tokens, which stay in the owner-only config.json instead of riding a second file.
# Every field is optional bar `name` (the rig's stratum name). Validation is fail-closed: an entry
# with ANY invalid field is dropped whole, so a typo'd `host` can never leave its token attached
# to the miner-IP fallback path (#122). pithead validates the same shape loudly at apply; this
# parse only has to stay safe if the mount is stale or hand-edited.
#
# The descriptors live at workers.list[] (#506) and nowhere else. Until 2.0.0 an unset or empty
# workers.list fell back to the deprecated dashboard.workers[] (#172); that alias was removed in
# #1832 and pithead migrates a pre-2.0 config to workers.list[] before the dashboard ever reads
# the mount, so this loader needs no fallback and an alias left in a stale mount reads as absent.
#   name  — 1-128 printable non-space ASCII chars (matched against the stratum name, '+' stripped)
#   host  — hostname or IPv4 literal: letters/digits/dot/dash/underscore only, so a config value
#           can never smuggle a port, path, or userinfo into the probe URL (no ':/@?#'; IPv6
#           literals are not supported)
#   port  — integer 1-65535 (bool is an int subclass — rejected explicitly)
#   token — 1-128 printable non-space ASCII chars (header-safe)
#   watts — a positive number: the operator's manual power-draw estimate for a rig whose enriched
#           feed reports no RAPL watts (macOS, non-RigForge, or an old kit), so the energy/profit
#           calculator (#260) can still total the fleet draw. Marked "estimated" in the UI.

    optional and validated; a missing/invalid value falls back to its default so a typo degrades the
    feature (profit math hidden) instead of crashing the dashboard. pithead validates the same shape
    loudly at apply.

    ``cost_per_kwh`` — electricity price per kWh (0/unset ⇒ cost + profit hidden, energy view only).

                       same ``currency`` as ``cost_per_kwh``. Static by default (no unbidden price
                       egress); the fallback when ``price_feed`` is on but hasn't fetched yet.

                       P2Pool XMR only). Same static-by-default reasoning as ``xmr_price``; folds
                       Tari's merge-mined earnings into net profit once both prices are known.
    ``currency``     — display label for all figures (e.g. USD, EUR). Label only — no conversion.
    ``price_feed``   — opt-in (default off): fetch both prices live from CoinGecko over Tor
                       (``service/xvb/price_feed.py``) instead of the static numbers above, which then
