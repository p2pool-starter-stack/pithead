"""Healthchecks.io dead-man's-switch pinger (Issue #79).

A thin, self-contained client the data loop calls once per cycle to ping a unique
Healthchecks.io URL. The value is in what *stops* happening: if the host dies, the
dashboard dies with it, the pings stop, and Healthchecks.io fires an alert on the absence
of a ping — evaluated on *their* servers, so it survives the very outage (power loss, kernel
panic, NIC death) an in-stack notifier can't report from a dead machine.

Design notes:
- **Off until configured.** No ``ping_url`` → the client is a no-op: :meth:`ping` returns
  immediately, opens no socket, and logs nothing. Setting a URL is what turns it on.
- **Always over Tor.** The ping rides the bridge Tor SOCKS proxy so the endpoint sees a Tor
  exit, not the host IP — it's never a clearnet beacon.
- **Fails silently, but rejection is loud.** A ping that can't *reach* the endpoint (offline, or
  Tor momentarily down) is logged at DEBUG only, consistent with the stack's offline check
  discipline (#59). A ping the endpoint *rejects* (non-2xx — a revoked or typo'd URL) is a
  different failure mode: it doesn't self-heal, so it logs a WARNING, once, on the transition
  from OK to rejected (and an INFO on recovery) — #560.
- **Throttled.** :data:`interval` is a floor between pings; the loop calls every cycle but we
  only hit the network once per interval. The throttle clock only advances on a *successful*
  send, so while offline we keep retrying every cycle rather than backing off.

Manual setup: the operator pastes the full ping URL from Healthchecks.io (hosted or a
Tor-reachable self-hosted instance). Auto-provisioning via the Management API (which would
mean storing a powerful API key) is intentionally left out — see ``docs/monitoring.md``.
