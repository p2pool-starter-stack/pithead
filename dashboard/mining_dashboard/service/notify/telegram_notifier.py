class TelegramNotifier:
    """
    Thin, fire-and-forget Telegram push notifier (Issue #121).

    Pushes short operational alerts to a single chat via the Bot API ``sendMessage``
    endpoint. Deliberately minimal — there is no interactive bot, no commands, no polling
    (that's #45); this is the notifications-only half.

    Discipline (mirrors the rest of the stack):

    - **Disabled by default.** ``enabled`` is only true when explicitly switched on *and*
      both ``bot_token`` and ``chat_id`` are present. A missing/half-filled config leaves it
      off, so :meth:`send` is a silent no-op rather than an error on every cycle.
    - **Per-event toggles.** ``events`` gates which alert kinds are delivered, so an operator
      can enable Telegram and still silence the ones they find noisy.
    - **Always over Tor.** Sends ride the bridge Tor SOCKS proxy (``socks5h``, so the DNS lookup
      goes through Tor too), so Telegram sees a Tor exit, not the host IP — never a clearnet beacon,
      matching the Healthchecks.io pinger (#79) and the XvB fetch (#163).
    - **Fail silent.** Any network error (offline host, Tor down, Telegram unreachable / blocking a
      Tor exit) is swallowed and logged at debug — an alerter must never crash the data loop or spam
      ERROR for the very condition it exists to report (#59 discipline).
    - **Never logs the token.** ``bot_token`` is a secret; it only ever appears in the request
      URL and is never written to a log line — not even inside an exception message (which for
      ``requests`` would otherwise include the full URL).
