"""Bounded, targeted worker-status refresh after a successful one-click rig upgrade (issue #1233,
companion to #893).

The per-rig RigForge version shown to the operator is derived at the render seam from the rig's
own last-reported ``/1/summary`` (``web/views/infra_views.py``'s ``rigforge_update_for`` —
never stored, so it can't outlive its input, the #664 lesson). That read normally happens once per
``UPDATE_INTERVAL`` on the shared poll loop (``DataService.run``), so after an upgrade the operator
watches a stale badge for up to a full cycle even though the dashboard already knows the exact
moment the rig finished rebuilding.

This module does nothing that loop doesn't already do — it makes the SAME ``/1/summary`` probe
(``XMRigWorkerClient.get_stats``) the SAME way, just for the ONE rig that just upgraded, and only a
few times right after upgrade success. It never re-derives "latest available release" (that lookup
stays on its own Tor-throttled cadence, the anti-beacon contract ``update_checker`` owns) and never
changes anything (read-only). ``web/server.py``'s ``_finalize_worker_upgrade`` is the one caller,
triggered only on a worker-upgrade result that means the rig actually rebuilt (``applied`` or
``accepted`` — not a rejection/failure/rollback/throttle, where nothing changed rig-side).
