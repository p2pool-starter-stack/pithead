"""Click-to-adopt a rig: the dashboard-side half of the adopt flow (the operator-decision
comment, issue #893).

The write itself rides the EXISTING control-channel config path — the same preview/commit
mechanics ``ConfigView`` uses for any other edit (no new write endpoint, ``web/server.py``
``handle_control_preview``/``handle_control_commit``). This module only builds the one guard that
path needs to carry a ``workers.list[]`` write at all: ``pithead``'s ``control_approval_gate``
(``pithead`` ~L9695) refuses ANY diff to the per-worker descriptors outright — deliberately, since
they hold per-rig hosts and bearer tokens (the #122 SSRF class) — with a single narrow exception
for a strictly ADD-ONLY append (a brand-new descriptor; every already-live entry must reappear
byte-for-byte). That host-side gate is the actual security authority and is exercised at commit.

What lives here is the *dashboard-side* mirror of the same shape/charset validation pithead's own
``validate_worker_endpoints`` applies (defense in depth, the same pattern ``control_service``'s
``SECRET_PATHS``/``EDITABLE_ENV_KEY_PATHS`` already follow), wired into ``handle_control_preview``
so a malformed adopt submission is refused before it ever reaches the spool — never a
miner-advertised value auto-trusted: the host field the operator confirms is still just a
PREFILL, and every field here is exactly what the operator typed or edited in the adopt form.

def host_is_internal(host, live_cfg):
    """BEST-EFFORT, PREVIEW-TIME UX ONLY — this is NOT the security boundary. #893 round 5: an
    earlier version of this function (and its bash/JS mirrors) classified a host purely by STRING
    SHAPE, and an independent review found that a spelling denylist can never answer "does this
    hostname resolve to my own loopback": this host's own machine-name self-entry (Debian gives
    every box's own hostname a loopback ``/etc/hosts`` entry, e.g. ``127.0.1.1``) and an
    attacker-controlled DNS name pointed at ``127.0.0.1`` both looked like "a genuine hostname,
    therefore safe" — verified live with curl. The actual fix is RESOLVE-AND-CHECK, but that needs
    a real (and here, synchronous-request-blocking) DNS round trip, which does not belong in this
    module's fast, synchronous, dependency-free preview-time validation path. So this function
    keeps doing what it always could: refuse a value that is ALREADY numeric (an IP literal,
    including the ambiguous encodings below) or matches a KNOWN loopback spelling, purely to give
    the operator immediate, in-browser feedback on the obvious cases. A hostname it doesn't
    recognize — including ``gouda`` or any other name that would resolve to loopback — passes HERE
    and is still caught by the actual authority: ``pithead``'s ``_control_host_is_internal``, which
    runs at commit time on the host and genuinely resolves the name before deciding (see
    ``tests/service/workers/test_worker_adopt.py``'s ``test_a_hostname_that_would_resolve_elsewhere_is_not_caught_here_by_design``,
    which pins this limitation as a test rather than leaving it as a comment-only claim).

    What IS still caught here: loopback, "this network", link-local, multicast/reserved,
    ``localhost`` (and its standard ``/etc/hosts`` aliases and root-terminated spelling — see
    below), or the stack's own docker-bridge subnet (``network.subnet``, read from the SAME live
    config the caller already has). An ordinary LAN/public rig address is unaffected.

    A trailing dot is DNS's "FQDN root" marker — resolvers (and curl) treat ``localhost.`` exactly
    like ``localhost`` — so it is stripped before any hostname comparison, or the root-terminated
    spelling sails past a literal-string match untouched. ``localhost.localdomain`` /
    ``ip6-localhost`` / ``ip6-loopback`` are the standard ``/etc/hosts`` loopback aliases on
    Debian/RHEL-family Linux (this stack's own target OS) — refused explicitly, not just the bare
    ``localhost`` family.

    A string this host's own dial (curl, in the runner) would treat as numeric must be recognized
    as one here too, or an alternate encoding of the very addresses above — a bare decimal integer
    ("2130706433"), an octal-leading-zero octet ("0177.0.0.1"), hex ("0x7f000001"), or a
    short/collapsed form ("127.1") all resolve to a real address curl accepts — sails through
    misclassified as "just a hostname". So: any letter (other than a literal "0x"/"0X" hex marker)
    means a real hostname, never re-resolved here (the same accepted, pre-existing limit the
    read-path guard has, ``_safe_probe_host``); anything else — digits, dots, or a hex marker — is
    a numeric-address ATTEMPT, and Python's own strict ``ipaddress`` parse (which, unlike curl,
    already refuses all of the ambiguous forms above) failing to recognize it means REFUSE, never
    "must be a hostname after all"."""
