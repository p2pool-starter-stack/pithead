"""The dashboard's own record of the worker config changes it sent (#185), split out of
`storage_service.py`.

This is a MIXIN, not a facade: `StateManager` inherits it, so these methods keep the same `self`,
the same `_conn`, the same `_db_lock` and the same transaction scope they had when they were
defined inline. That distinction is what the #1105 "do not split `storage_service.py`" ruling
turns on — it refused a new seam between callers and the single DB handle, and a mixin introduces
none. The same narrowing the telemetry split was taken under (#1369), and the same proof class,
except that the proof now ships as `tests/service/test_mixin_atomicity.py` rather than as a
one-off pass: no method here holds a transaction or cursor across a call into a method that
stayed behind, and CI re-checks that on every later PR instead of once.

The boundary is the `worker_config` TABLE — every accessor of it moves and nothing else does, so
the seam is one the code already drew rather than one invented for the cut. `worker_history` and
its `get_worker_hashrate_by_config` reader stay behind: that pair is hashrate telemetry keyed by
config version, not the change record itself.

Why this cut was taken: `storage_service.py` sat at its recorded file-budget ceiling with zero
headroom, and #1369's fix — an exact-id provenance lookup the 50-row history window cannot answer
— has to land somewhere. It lands here, in the module that owns the table it reads.

        Read-then-write under the one ``_db_lock``, in a single method, because the comparison IS

        Returns ``None`` for the ordinary case — nothing to compare (a rig seen for the first time,

        A dict ``{worker, before, after}`` means the rig's config changed with no new

        durable record is the Security panel's job; this line describes the config the rig is
        serving NOW, so it answers only while the drift we stored produced ``revision`` — what
        the rig reports on THIS poll. "Ever drifted?" would accuse a rig forever, long after the

        ``config_drift`` withholds its ``[]`` — an all-clear here would be a reassurance bounded
        by narrowings the operator cannot see from a badge, this feature's own defect inverted.

        Deliberately NOT a lookup of the ``rig-drift`` audit row by its ``event_id``: that id is
        deterministic and the join is cheaper, but its format is not a contract, and a lookup
        built on one would fail SILENTLY when the format moved — the note would stop rendering
        and every test written against the old shape would stay green.
