"""Spooling for the read-only diagnostics verbs (#913 doctor detail, #943 log tail).

Split out of control_service.py rather than added to it: that module is at its recorded line
ceiling, and these two intents are the only ones in the channel that carry no operator input the
host must gate — they ASK for a report and mutate nothing, which is why they skip the approval
path every committing verb goes through.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE: a copy of the host's container allowlist. The authority is
PITHEAD_DIAG_CONTAINERS in lib/pithead/46a-control-diagnostics.sh, which matches by exact
membership; a second list in this container is how the two drift, and the drift would fail in the
direction that looks like a dashboard bug. This module checks only that the name is a plausible
compose service (charset + length), so a malformed request gets a fast, clear 400 instead of a
round-trip; deciding whether a WELL-FORMED name may be read is the host's, and its refusal comes
back as a "rejected" result the panel shows verbatim.
