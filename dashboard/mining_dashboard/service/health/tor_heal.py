"""Tor guard self-heal (#424) — restart the tor container when clearnet egress is stuck.

Tor can bootstrap to 100% yet sit on a FAILING GUARD: circuits build but clearnet exits time
out at the 60s cutoff, so every Tor-clearnet feature (Healthchecks pings, the Telegram bot,
XvB stats) dies at once while mining — onion / already-established circuits — keeps working
and the stack looks healthy. Seen live in production after the v1.3.0 deploy: ~6 hours dark
until a manual ``docker compose restart tor`` reselected guards. The doctor check (v1.3.1)
detects this state; this monitor is the heal half.

It is **opt-in** (``tor.auto_heal: true``): a tor restart drops ALL circuits — the mining
onions included, which then rebuild — so the stack never restarts its privacy boundary behind
the operator's back by default. When off, this class does nothing: no probe traffic, no
restarts.

Guardrails — a restart storm is worse than a stuck guard (the tor log's own diagnosis is "the
Tor network is overloaded", so fresh guards may be just as bad):

- **Probe, not inference.** The trigger is the same active probe as the doctor check — one
  GET to a no-content endpoint through the Tor SOCKS — on a fixed cadence, never a guess from
  app-level failures.
- **Sustained, not a blip.** Egress must fail continuously for :data:`BROKEN_AFTER_SEC`
  before the first restart.
- **Cooldown.** At least :data:`COOLDOWN_SEC` between restarts, so later probes verify the
  new guards actually work before another attempt is allowed.
- **Bounded.** At most :data:`MAX_RESTARTS` restarts per outage; past that it only warns
  (the doctor check and the Healthchecks dead-man's switch remain the operator's signal).
  The budget resets only after :data:`RECOVERY_CONFIRM_PROBES` consecutive OK probes —
  sustained recovery, so a lone lucky 204 during a flapping outage can't refill the cap and
  turn "3 per outage" into 3-every-half-hour-forever.
- **Loud.** Every restart and give-up is logged at WARNING; recovery after a restart sends a
  one-time Telegram note — deliverable exactly then, since Telegram rides the path that just
  healed.

The restart goes through the same start/stop-only docker-control proxy as the #31 failover.
The manual leg is ``./pithead restart tor``. Real stuck-guard recovery is tier 4 (the live bench).

A successful tor restart is followed by a monerod restart when the node is local (#972): the tor
restart kills every SOCKS connection, and monerod keeps its dead peer sockets — bench-observed at
0 in / 0 out peers for ~6 hours while every healthcheck stayed green. Compose couples the same
restart for its own operations (``depends_on: tor: restart: true``); this healer bypasses compose,
so it couples it here. Best-effort: a failed monerod cycle is logged and never refunds the tor
attempt (the tor restart DID happen) — the out-of-sync alert is the backstop.
