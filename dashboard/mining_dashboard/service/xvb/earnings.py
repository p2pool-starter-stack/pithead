"""Expected-earnings model (Issue #12).

A thin domain layer over ``service/metrics`` and the live Monero network figures that
answers "what should this hashrate earn?". It is deliberately small and **linear**: the
expected XMR a given hashrate earns is the standard variance-free mining expectation

    E[XMR/s] = hashrate * block_reward / network_difficulty

The network's target block time cancels out (``network_hashrate = difficulty / block_time``
and ``E = hashrate / network_hashrate * reward / block_time``), so the rate depends only on
the block reward and the network difficulty — both already collected for the XMR Network panel.

Because earnings are linear in hashrate, the server only needs to publish the **rate per H/s**;
the dashboard's *what-if* hashrate input scales that one rate to any entered hashrate on the
client (instant, no re-derivation, no round trip) — see ``web/static/app/logic.mjs``. Keeping the
rate here (one source of truth) is the #61 principle: presentation layers read the metrics, they
don't re-derive the math.

The same expectation covers Tari (#117): merge-mining puts the full P2Pool hashrate to work on
the Tari aux chain *alongside* Monero, so ``xtm_per_hs_day`` is the identical linear rate over the
Tari difficulty and block reward p2pool's merge-mine stats already report (``collector/pools.py``).
The XvB tier estimate is still deferred (per the Issue #12 discussion), and hashrate currently
donated to XvB isn't subtracted here — the estimate assumes the supplied hashrate mines via
P2Pool, which the dashboard states in its disclaimer.

Alongside the model sits ``confirmed_payouts_summary`` (#787): the same domain layer, but over
what the view-only wallets actually recorded (#381/#462) rather than what the model predicts.
It lives here so the dashboard card and the Telegram bot roll the running windows up exactly
once, from one implementation — the #61 principle again.
