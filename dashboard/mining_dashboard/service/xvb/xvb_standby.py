"""Backup-stack XvB warm-standby puller (#249).

Two full Pithead hosts sharing one Monero/Tari wallet run as a failover pair: workers list both in
``pools[]`` (primary first), and on a primary outage they fail over to the backup. The backup's XvB
donation controller would otherwise cold-start — it restarts the donation split from the feedforward
estimate and re-ramps for hours — so its credited tier over/under-shoots until the closed loop
reconverges.

This service closes that gap on the **backup**: when ``xvb.standby.source`` names the primary's
dashboard, it periodically pulls the primary's read-only ``/api/xvb-standby`` and holds the result as
*standby* state (``StateManager.set_xvb_standby``). It is never acted on while the primary is
authoritative — the backup has no workers then, so its controller stays on P2Pool regardless. The
adoption happens only at failover, inside ``AlgoService._seed_donation_fraction``, when the backup
first actually donates.

One-way, backup-pulls-from-primary; inert unless configured (blank source = off). The pull follows
the dashboard's #160-safe egress rule (``_proxies`` / ``egress._xvb_standby_route``): an ``.onion``
source, a public IP, or any hostname rides the bridge Tor SOCKS — so the primary sees a Tor exit,
never the backup's real IP — and only a provably-private/loopback IP *literal* dials direct as a LAN
hop. It never opens a clearnet path. Every failure is silent — a missed pull just keeps the
last-held standby, and a backup with no standby yet simply cold-starts as before.
