        Comparing against ``held_decision`` is the #423 fix. The old test —
        "would we donate at all?" (``decision in ("XVB", "SPLIT")``) — is a
        tautology during a SPLIT remainder: the fraction is static while
        ``advance=False``, so the recomputed decision is SPLIT by construction and
        every remainder collapsed to a single check tick. The actuated donation
        duty became slice/(slice + tick) instead of slice/cycle — an order of
        magnitude above the commanded fraction at small fractions — and the
        controller could not unwind it (its command was already near 0). That is
        the sustained credited overshoot of #423.
