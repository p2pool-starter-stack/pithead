# Restart timeouts for the clearnet→Tor flip (#234). A daemon can be slow to stop (Tari took >10s

# (with the old `stop and start`) skipped the start entirely, leaving the daemon down.

class ClearnetSyncSupervisor:
    """Auto-transition a clearnet-syncing node back to Tor once it's synced (#183/#234).

    When ``monero.clearnet_initial_sync`` / ``tari.clearnet_initial_sync`` is on, the daemon does
    its initial block download over CLEARNET (fast) instead of Tor — briefly exposing this host's IP
    to that chain's P2P network. This supervisor watches the per-chain "synced" signal the data loop
    already computes; the first time a clearnet node reports synced it drops a persistent marker in
    the shared ``state_dir`` and restarts the container. The daemon's entrypoint, seeing the marker,
    comes back up Tor-only — and stays there across restarts/``apply`` (a reboot can't silently
    re-expose it). The marker is removed by ``pithead`` only when the flag is re-enabled, re-arming.

    Direction is one-way: it only ever moves a node TOWARD Tor. Fail-safe: the marker is written
    BEFORE the restart (so the restarted container is guaranteed to pick Tor), and a failed restart
    is retried on the next cycle rather than left half-done — a node is never silently stranded on
    clearnet.

    The supervisor is intentionally passive about chains whose flag is off; it only acts on the ones
    the operator opted into.
