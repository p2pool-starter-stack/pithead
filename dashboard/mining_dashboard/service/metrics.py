"""Typed metrics/domain layer (Issue #61).

``build_metrics`` turns the untyped ``latest_data`` snapshot (plus a little ``state_manager``
state) into a frozen ``Metrics`` dataclass of **computed, unformatted domain values** —
effective hashrate, P2Pool/XvB averages, XvB tiers, shares-in-PPLNS-window, worker counts,
per-node sync/down state, and the raw pool/network figures a payout calculator needs.

This is the single place those values are derived. The web view layer formats display strings
*from* ``Metrics`` (format at the edge); other consumers — e.g. the planned Telegram notifier
(#45) and XvB/P2Pool calculator (#12) — read the same ``Metrics`` instead of re-deriving from
the raw dict or scraping rendered HTML. Nothing here formats or emits markup.
