"""Read-only views over the host-written security logs (#349).

Two sources, both mounted read-only: the #33 config-change audit trail
(``/control/audit/control.log``, one JSON line per handled control request) and Caddy's JSON
access log (``/access-log/access.log``) — the operator's brute-force signal, since over Tor there
is no source IP and the only useful pattern is the rate of 401s.

Every field read here is HOSTILE input: the access log echoes attacker-chosen strings (the
request URI, the attempted username), and a log line rendered raw into the dashboard would be
stored XSS against the operator — the exact attacker-to-operator direction the #33 reviews
guarded. ``_clean`` therefore whitelists a conservative ASCII charset (no ``<``, ``>``, quotes,
backslashes, or control characters) and caps length; nothing from either file is served
unfiltered. Growth is bounded by the writers, not here: the audit log is trimmed by
``control_audit`` and Caddy rolls its own access log — this module only ever reads a tail.

    ``_SAFE_CHARS``, so leaving it would push an otherwise-fine id onto the digest branch below.
    Replacing AFTER quoting is unambiguous because ``quote`` never emits a bare ``%2D`` or ``%7E``
    of its own — a literal ``%`` in the input has already become ``%25``. Everything this returns

    the poll loop, where the old bare join never encoded anything at all. A surrogate in the WORKER

    step; #1696 fixed that, and the fix routes the value HERE instead — an id sqlite could never
