"""Bounded reads for every external HTTP fetch (#660).

Each external client (GitHub release checks #224, the three XvB reads, the CoinGecko price feed
#651, the Tor egress probe, the Healthchecks ping, the Telegram getUpdates long-poll) is
individually tolerant of a bad *parse*, but nothing bounded what got *read*: a hostile or broken
endpoint could hand any of them a multi-GB body and the process would buffer it all before
parsing. ``bounded_get`` streams the body and cuts it at a cap far above any legitimate payload;
over-cap raises a ``requests.RequestException`` subclass, so every caller's existing failure
contract (return ``None`` / keep the last good result) applies unchanged.

#660 exempted the clients it judged *internal* — the on-box or same-LAN endpoints. That exemption
did not survive contact: the rig poll was in the untreated set and needed bounding anyway (#1347),
because "our own container" describes who serves the body, not who wrote it. xmrig-proxy's summary
is built from what miners advertise; container logs carry miner-supplied worker names and pool
messages; and a *remote* monerod is someone else's server on someone else's network. #1360 brings
the rest of that set behind the same two helpers — ``bounded_get`` for the ``requests`` sites,
``bounded_read`` for the ``aiohttp`` ones.

    Takes the response's ``content`` stream rather than making the request, because the async call
    sites differ in everything except this one step — session, params, timeout, and whether they
    want bytes, text or JSON. Bounding the read is the only part they share.

    **This is deliberately not a single ``read(max_bytes)``.** ``aiohttp``'s ``StreamReader.read(n)``
    is a SHORT read: it returns what is currently buffered, never necessarily ``n`` bytes. A body
    split across TCP reads — any link with latency — would come back truncated, and the far end
    would then read as broken for a reason with nothing to do with its size. Measured against a real
    aiohttp server while fixing #1347: one ``read(1000)`` of a 994-byte body returned 100 bytes.

    So it accumulates until EOF or one byte PAST the cap, which is what makes the boundary exact —
    a body of exactly ``max_bytes`` is returned, ``max_bytes + 1`` refuses. ``Content-Length`` is
    deliberately never consulted: the far end picks it, so trusting it would let a hostile endpoint
    declare 10 bytes and send 10 GB.

    Raises :class:`ResponseTooLarge`, the same type the sync twin raises, so a caller's existing
    ``except Exception`` fail-silent path applies unchanged.
