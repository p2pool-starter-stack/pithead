# The log read is the one bounded site (#1360) where a legitimately large body exists, so the cap
# is derived from what the operator asked for rather than fixed. ``tail`` bounds LINES, never bytes,
# so a container emitting very long lines is unbounded — and container logs carry miner-supplied
# strings (worker names, pool messages), which is why "our own daemon serves it" is not the question.
#
# 16 KiB is where Docker's json-file driver splits a log line, so ``tail * 16 KiB`` is the ceiling a
# well-behaved daemon can legitimately produce for the requested number of lines. The 1 MiB floor
# keeps the default (100 lines) generous. A cap set too tight is worse than the exhaustion it
# prevents, because it presents to the operator as the far end being broken rather than as a refusal.
#
# Both halves of that were measured against a live stack (#1360), because they are claims about an
# external system rather than about our code. The driver does split at exactly 16384 payload bytes: a
# single 40,960-byte line came back as frames of 16384 / 16384 / 8193. And the half the derivation
# silently depends on — ``tail=N`` counts FRAMES, not logical lines — holds too: ``tail=1`` against
# that three-frame line returns only its last 8193-byte fragment. Were ``tail`` counting logical
# lines, no per-line constant could bound the response at all.
_LOG_BYTES_PER_LINE = 16 * 1024

# ...but the payload is not the whole frame. Docker prefixes each one with an 8-byte header (stream
# type, three pad bytes, then a big-endian uint32 payload size — see ``_parse_docker_stream``), and
# ``bounded_read`` counts RAW STREAM bytes, headers included. A cap of ``tail * 16 KiB`` is therefore
# short by ``tail * 8`` against what a completely full window legitimately weighs, so the maximally
# packed case — the exact case the ceiling exists to admit — was refused. Measured: three frames
# whose payloads sum to 40,961 arrive as 40,985 raw bytes.
