"""
Closed-loop simulator for the XvB donation controller (Issue #70).

The live `AlgoService` controller decides, each ~10-minute cycle, what fraction of
the cycle to donate to XMRvsBeast. It steers off the XvB API's *windowed averages*
(`avg_1h` / `avg_24h`) — but those averages are a slow, laggy function of the
controller's own past donations. That feedback loop is exactly where a single-step
unit test is blind: over-donation only manifests as a sustained overshoot that
builds up over hours and lingers for a day.

This module closes that loop so any candidate controller can be validated *before*
we ship it. It models the measurement (the rolling windows the XvB API reports),
runs a controller against it for a configurable number of cycles, and reports the
metrics that actually matter for the raffle:

  * peak / steady-state overshoot vs the target tier (waste — the raffle gives
    zero benefit above threshold, so every H/s over target is p2pool hashrate
    thrown away),
  * whether the tier is *held* (1h/24h stay at or above threshold — required to
    qualify), and
  * p2pool efficiency (the share of hashrate kept on p2pool).

A controller is just a callable ``decide(current_hr, stable_hr, avg_1h, avg_24h)
-> donated_fraction`` in ``[0, 1]``. `make_algo_controller` adapts the real
`AlgoService` so we test the shipping code path (min-dwell, remainder rules and
all), but a hand-written candidate controller can be dropped in just as easily.
