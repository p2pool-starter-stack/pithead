"""The Worker Inspect payload (#185) — one rig's telemetry, its writable config, and its change
history — assembled for ``/api/worker/{name}``.

Split out of ``views.py`` when #1345 added the config-provenance keys below. The direction of the
import is deliberate and one-way: this module reads ``views``' formatting helpers, and ``views``
never reads this one, so the split cannot become a cycle. Everything here still obeys the view
layer's rule from Issue #61 — format at the edge, emit tokens and display strings, never HTML.

**Provenance (#1345).** ``rig_config_meta`` is the rig's own account of when its writable config
last changed and what changed it, already validated against RigForge's vocabulary in
``client/rig_config_meta.py``. ``config_origin`` is the verdict the operator actually wants: did
this change come from here, or did something change it underneath me? Answering that needs one
fact only this side holds — whether the rig's ``last_change_id`` matches a change *this* dashboard
spooled *for this rig*. The rig mints those ids in its control server and hands them back in the
202, so an id in this rig's own history is an id we asked for.

The comparison is evidence, not proof, and one case escapes it. RigForge serves ``revision``
recomputed live but takes the other three from a marker file it writes only when a change is
*recorded* (``_stamp_config_meta``), and the marker's own stored revision is overwritten by the live
one before it goes on the wire. So a config hand-edited underneath RigForge moves the revision while
the provenance stays stale, and ``config_origin`` reports the change before it — reading as "here"
over a config we did not set.

**``config_drift`` (#1367) answers that one directly, and without the persistence this module was
once expected to need.** Both halves of a value comparison are already in this payload —
``last_applied`` from our own history, ``rig_config`` from the rig's feed (#1235) — so asking "is
the rig running what we applied?" needs no revision hash reproduced byte for byte, no new column and
no RigForge change. It answers on keys we have set; a hand-edit to a key we never applied still
moves only the revision, and still needs the observed-revision persistence to catch.

A rig that is lying can also replay an id we really did send it. Within what a rig reports honestly,
the dashboard's own half errs one way only: every input it cannot vouch for lands on "not ours".

This is not a new capability from nothing: #530 already notices a rig-applied change, but only
while a poll is watching a terminal report go by, and only ever as a change_id. The keys here make
the same answer persistent and specific — it survives a restart, and it survives nobody watching.

    """Keys where the rig's current writable config disagrees with what this dashboard last applied.

    The question #1367 asks — *is the rig running what we last applied?* — answered by comparing the
    two values already in this payload, with no revision hash to reproduce byte for byte, no new
    column and no RigForge change. #1345's provenance line reports the last change the rig
    **recorded**; a config edited underneath RigForge records nothing, so the line keeps reading
    "Last changed from this dashboard" over a config we did not set. This is the check that catches
    that, and it works on rigs already deployed.

    Returns a list of ``{key, applied, rig}`` — empty meaning checked and in agreement — or ``None``
    when the comparison could not honestly be made. The UI must keep those apart: ``[]`` is a
    finding, ``None`` is silence.

    Three things bound what it can claim, each a deliberate narrowing rather than an oversight:

    - **Only keys we have applied.** ``last_applied`` is a merge of DIFFS, not a config, so it holds
      exactly the keys this dashboard has ever set. A hand-edit to a writable key we never touched
      moves the rig's revision and is invisible here — that is option A's coverage, not this one's.
    - **Never the pool credentials.** ``strip_credentials`` runs over BOTH sides before comparing.
      RigForge deletes ``pass`` and ``tls-fingerprint`` before serving, so a password we once
      applied would otherwise be permanent, uncloseable drift on our side alone. The rig side needs
      the same pass for a different reason: ``_rig_writable_config`` masks a credential it does
      receive to a ``{__secret__: true}`` sentinel (#1548) rather than stripping it, so a rig that
      still serves ``pass`` would compare that sentinel against our stripped value and read as
      permanent drift too, in the other direction. Stripping both sides costs the ability to notice
      a changed pool password, which nothing on this side can see anyway.
    - **Never mid-flight.** A submitted change sits at ``accepted`` until the reconciler settles it,
      and is not in ``last_applied`` while the rig may already be running it — so comparing inside
      that window reports drift on a key we ourselves just set. Judged on the NEWEST apply row
      rather than on whether any unsettled row exists anywhere: an old ``accepted`` row that never
      settled is a stuck record, not a change in flight, and letting one suppress this check forever
      would trade a false alarm for permanent silence.
