"""Time-series sections for the dashboard: the ``/api/state`` blocks that carry a *history* rather
than a current reading — share health, blocks, payouts, disk growth, XvB history — plus the two
headline rate cards, hashrate and cadence, that summarise the same series.

Split out of ``web/views/views.py`` (#1105). What lives here is the persisted per-poll share-health
deltas (#116), the Tier-1 telemetry backbone's three formatters (#196), the pool/mode palette
tokens (#27) and the hashrate and cadence cards. They share the chart hub's downsampling bounds
and range filter, so they sit together rather than beside the point-in-time status sections.
``views.py`` stays the facade — ``build_state`` assembles these sections and
``web/views/worker_detail.py`` imports the gauge-series helper from there — so the move is invisible to
consumers.

Presentation only, per Issue #61: domain values are computed in ``service/metrics.py``; this layer
formats at the edge and emits tokens the client maps to CSS, never HTML.
