"""XvB, earnings and top-bar badges for the dashboard: the ``/api/state`` sections that turn
raffle status, donation tiers and expected payouts into display values (Issues #12, #27, #118).

Split out of ``web/views/views.py`` (#1105). Everything here is presentation: the badge list the top bar
renders, the expected-XMR/XTM inputs the earnings calculator shows, the measured-vs-published
realization band, and the tier calculator's copy. ``views.py`` stays the facade — ``build_state``
assembles these sections and ``service/notify/telegram_commands.py`` imports :func:`build_badges` from
there — so the move is invisible to consumers.

Nothing here formats HTML; it emits tokens and display strings and lets the client render.

# is just failing right now, e.g. a transient bot-challenge, and the honest read is "estimate

# live figure, and it feeds the SAME ``XVB_REALIZATION_PRIOR`` band above, never a second,

    """Expected-XMR-from-P2Pool calculator inputs for the Advanced view (Issue #12).

    ``payouts`` (#381), when the view-only wallet feature is on, is the stored confirmed-payout
    list; it's rolled into a ``confirmed`` block (yesterday / 24h / 7d / 30d / all-time XMR, #787)
    shown beside this estimate — the estimate is a model, the confirmed figure is ground truth from
    the wallet. ``tari_payouts`` (#462) is the same for the Tari side, rolled into
    ``tari_confirmed`` (XTM) beside the Tari time-to-block estimate.

    This is a **P2Pool** mining calculator: it estimates the XMR earned by the hashrate that is
    actually mining on your P2Pool node — *not* the rig's total output. The what-if default is
    ``p2pool_1h`` — the **same P2Pool 1h-average hashrate shown in the header / Overview / My Node
    cards** (a time-weighted average of the recorded P2Pool hashrate), so the figure here matches
    those exactly. That recorded average already excludes any XvB-donated slice (XvB hashrate is a
    separate series), which is why an active XvB split doesn't inflate the estimate.

    Tari merge-mining rides along (#117): the same P2Pool hashrate simultaneously works the Tari
    aux chain, so the payload carries a second rate — XTM per H/s per day, over the Tari
    difficulty and block reward p2pool's merge-mine stats report. ``tari_available`` is gated on
    ``tari_mining`` as well as the rate, so a dead merge-mine channel can't show phantom XTM.

    Publishes the earnings **rate** (XMR per H/s per day, from ``service/earnings``) plus that
    P2Pool hashrate and the P2Pool share difficulty. The client scales the rate to the entered
    *what-if* hashrate and formats the day/month/year figures + expected time-to-share — sending
    a rate (not pre-formatted earnings) keeps the live recompute a single source of truth with no
    duplicated math (see ``web/static/app/logic.mjs``).

    The comparison the operator otherwise assembles by hand across the Earnings tabs: the linear
    expectation over a trailing window beside what the view-only wallets confirmed over the SAME
    window (#381/#462). Expected uses the time-weighted routed P2Pool average over the window
    itself (``metrics.p2pool_7d``/``p2pool_30d``), not the current 1h figure — a fleet that grew
    or shrank mid-window would otherwise be judged against the wrong baseline.

    Every stream shares ONE trailing 30d window (#817 — mixed windows read as inconsistent, and
    30d is the shortest span that means something for all three). **Monero + XvB** is ONE
    combined row: an XvB win pays out through ordinary small payouts the payout table cannot
    attribute, so the confirmed actual already contains XvB XMR — comparing it against a
    P2Pool-only expectation overshoots on a winning box (#817). Both sides count XvB instead:
    expected = the P2Pool linear model + XvB's published per-day estimate × 30 (folded only when
    fresh; ``includes_xvb`` tells the client which label to draw), actual = every confirmed
    payout; ``pct`` compares like with like, and ``partial`` carries the confirmed window's
    may-be-incomplete flag. The XvB addend is TEMPERED by this wallet's measured win realization
    when enough wins exist to measure it (#866 — see ``xvb_realization``); the published face
    value stays in the tooltip via ``xvb_realization_pct``/``xvb_wins_measured``. **Tari** compares BLOCK COUNTS: solo merge-mining pays whole blocks,
    so the honest unit is blocks (expected = hashrate × window ÷ aux difficulty; actual =
    confirmed payout count, each payout being a found block), with the XTM sum alongside — no
    percent, a count that small is luck either way. **XvB** keeps only its win count and last-win
    recency — its XMR value lives in the combined row by construction.
