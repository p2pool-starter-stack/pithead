"""Chart series for the dashboard: the window/range hub the ``/api/state`` chart payload is
built from (Issues #47, #65).

Split out of ``web/views/views.py`` (#1105) as the hub every other view cluster leans on: window
parsing and canonicalisation, range filtering, adaptive point-count/tension tiers, bucket
downsampling, and the marker series (shares, degradation events, raffle wins, payouts) that ride
their own hidden 0-1 axis. ``views.py`` stays the facade — it re-exports the names its callers
(``server.py``, ``worker_detail.py``) already import — so this move is invisible to consumers.

Nothing here formats display strings; it emits chart-ready points and lets the client render.
