"""Service Diagnostics routes (#913 doctor detail, #943 log tail).

Its own module rather than server.py's: that file holds every other handler and is at its
recorded line ceiling. These two handlers are also the channel's only READ-ONLY asks — they
submit an intent the host answers with a report and never a mutation — so they need none of the
approval, confirmation or history-recording machinery the committing handlers around them share.

Both return 202 with a request id; the client polls the existing GET /api/control/result, the
same way preview/commit/upgrade/backup already do. There is no second polling route.

THE TRUST BOUNDARY: this container decides nothing about what may be read. It shape-checks the
request so an obviously malformed one fails fast, and the HOST decides whether a well-formed
container name is one it will serve logs for. A refusal comes back as a "rejected" result with
the host's own reason, which the panel surfaces verbatim rather than reinterpreting.
