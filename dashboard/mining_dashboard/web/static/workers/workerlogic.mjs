// Pure logic for Worker Inspect's writable-config editor (#518), kept DOM-free so node --test
// covers it. Mirrors configlogic.mjs: buildFields flattens the writable allowlist + the
// last-applied config into typed table rows; buildTableChanges/parseJsonChanges fold an edit
// (table or JSON) back into the `changes` diff POSTed to /api/control/worker-apply. Both modes
// produce the exact same shape — a plain object of only the keys that actually changed.
//
// A writable value can itself be a masked token sentinel (#508/#440) — same {__secret__: true}
// shape the Configuration view already masks. buildFields turns that into a "secret" row so the
// table editor never hands the operator raw sentinel JSON to mangle; a blank secret row keeps it,
// a typed one replaces it, exactly like configlogic's secret fields.
//
// A sentinel can also sit NESTED inside a writable value — a pool's `pass` inside `pools` (#1548).
// buildFields' check above only ever sees the whole value, so a nested one is invisible to it;
// stripNestedSecrets (below) is the other half, scrubbing one out of whatever's about to be sent
// so the literal marker never travels as if it were a real credential. JSON mode diffs the whole
// textarea against `writableSnapshot`'s baseline for the same reason table mode already only
// diffs touched rows: without it, editing one unrelated key resends every prefilled value verbatim
// — including a credential this dashboard never held a plaintext copy of.
