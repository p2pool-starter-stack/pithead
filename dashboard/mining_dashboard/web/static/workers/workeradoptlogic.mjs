/**
 * BEST-EFFORT, IN-BROWSER UX ONLY — this is NOT the security boundary. An earlier version of this
 * (and its host-side and dashboard-side mirrors) classified a host purely by STRING SHAPE, and an
 * independent review found that a spelling denylist can never answer "does this hostname resolve
 * to my own loopback": this host's own machine-name self-entry and an attacker-controlled DNS name
 * both look like "a genuine hostname, therefore safe" to a string classifier alone. The real fix
 * is resolve-then-check, which needs an actual DNS round trip — not something this synchronous,
 * dependency-free, in-browser check can or should do. So this stays a fast, best-effort refusal of
 * the OBVIOUS cases only (an IP literal, including ambiguous encodings, or a known loopback
 * spelling); a hostname it doesn't recognize passes here and is still caught by the real
 * authority, which resolves it at commit time on the host (pithead's
 * ``_control_host_is_internal``) — see that function's own comment, and this file's own test
 * pinning exactly where this mirror's coverage stops.
 *
 * What IS still caught here (pithead's ``_control_host_is_internal`` / the dashboard's
 * ``worker_adopt.host_is_internal``): loopback, "this network", link-local, multicast/reserved,
 * "localhost" (and its standard ``/etc/hosts`` aliases and root-terminated spelling — see below),
 * or the stack's own docker-bridge subnet.
 *
 * A trailing dot is DNS's "FQDN root" marker — resolvers (and curl) treat "localhost." exactly
 * like "localhost" — so it is stripped before any hostname comparison. "localhost.localdomain" /
 * "ip6-localhost" / "ip6-loopback" are the standard ``/etc/hosts`` loopback aliases on
 * Debian/RHEL-family Linux (this stack's own target OS) — refused explicitly, not just the bare
 * "localhost" family.
 *
 * A host this stack's own dial would treat as numeric must be recognized as one here too, or an
 * alternate encoding of the very addresses above — a bare decimal integer ("2130706433"), an
 * octal-leading-zero octet ("0177.0.0.1"), hex ("0x7f000001"), or a short/collapsed form
 * ("127.1") — sails through misclassified as "just a hostname". So: any letter (other than a
 * literal "0x" hex marker) means a real hostname, never re-resolved here (the same accepted,
 * pre-existing limit the read-path guard has); anything else is a numeric-address ATTEMPT and is
 * refused outright unless it is the exact canonical form. Ambiguous never means "safe".
