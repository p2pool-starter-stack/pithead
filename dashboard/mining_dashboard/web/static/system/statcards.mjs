// identical to the old flat list once expanded. Expansion is persisted per card via
// loadPref/savePref — the same helpers dashboardEarningsTab already uses — keyed on `prefKey` so
// each card remembers its own state independently across a reload. The toggle is a real <button>
// with aria-expanded (not <details>/<summary>): that keeps the expanded/collapsed state explicit
// for assistive tech and gives the label control ("Show all (N)") the native disclosure triangle
