// hashrate, XvB's published face value and the study estimate (face x the measured on-chain
// delivery band). This wallet's own measured wins supersede the study band when they exist.
// Unsustainable tiers stay visible but grayed with the net withheld. No dropdown: the comparison
// IS the decision, so all tiers show at once.

// already fills that width — so it panned sideways and never showed a whole row. Stacked blocks
// wrap instead of panning, which is the only shape that fits this card.
