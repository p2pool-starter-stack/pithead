// Standardized Day/Month/Year estimate table — the one shape every earnings tab presents its

// (the same visibility gate the old per-cell fiat cards used). Replaces per-tab stat-grids whose
// two-column flow paired unrelated cells (XMR/year beside ≈/day). The coin triplet shares one
// precision (coinTriplet) so the rows align.
