// Highest sustainable XvB tier for a what-if hashrate (#118): the highest tier whose threshold
// clears `hashrateHs * calc.max_fraction`. A direct transcription of the AUTO path of
// helper/utils.resolve_target_threshold (get_tier_info over stable_hr × max_fraction) — a pinned
// test shares its inputs with the Python unit test so the two can't drift silently. Cost = the
// threshold itself: XvB qualifies a tier on BOTH the 1h and 24h credited averages, so holding it
// costs ~threshold H/s of continuous donation. Null when no tier is sustainable. Not gated on
// calc.enabled: the what-if runs from local hashrate and the published thresholds, so it answers
// "which tier could I hold?" before XvB is ever turned on (#938).

//   cost       — P2Pool earnings forgone donating the threshold (threshold x coeffDay x 365)
//   xvbSays    — XvB's published face-value reward (their number, shown as theirs)
//   study      — [lo, hi]: xvbSays x the measured delivery band (server-emitted; on-chain study
//                constant, 25 rounds: 32% of face, CI 27-38%, margin-invariant)
//   yours      — xvbSays x THIS wallet's measured realization, when >=5 wins exist (supersedes)

// A tier the what-if hashrate cannot sustain is flagged, its net withheld (an unreachable payout
// must not render as reachable). Pure + unit-tested; the component only renders these rows.
// Not gated on calc.enabled: the table is the enable/don't-enable decision aid (#938) — the
// server publishes the tiers either way, and a disabled box just has no live-credit context.

// even the pessimistic end profits. A band that straddles zero is a real "could go either way"
// verdict, so it says so in warn amber — as plain uncoloured text it was indistinguishable from a
// cell that carries no verdict at all (#1316).
