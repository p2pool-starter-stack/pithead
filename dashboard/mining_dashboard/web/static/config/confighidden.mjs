// Config paths the Configuration view never shows at all (#1850), and the round-trip that keeps
// what it hides intact. DOM-free, dependency-free, so `node --test` covers it directly.
//
// SSH on the appliance is a DEVELOPER feature: the 2.0 ruling is that a user never shells into
// the machine, and the ways in are the configuration stick and the `--ssh` debug image, neither
// of them this page. `ssh.*` is also in the host's never-approve set — the keys no remote channel
// may touch (os/overlay/pithead-media-config) — so the control gate refuses it however it
// arrives. That refusal is what produced the bug: an operator set `ssh.enabled`, pressed Review
// changes, and was told "No configuration changes detected", because the host had dropped the
// only key they had changed.
//
// This is a DISPLAY rule, not a security control. The gate on the host remains the authority;
// hiding the keys only stops the page offering a control it knows will be refused.
//
// It is a set of its own rather than the absence of a configlogic LOGICAL_GROUPS entry, because
// an unclaimed key falls into the catch-all "Other" group by design — dropping the group entry
// alone would MOVE the toggle, not remove it. Both are done, and this set is the one that
// decides. A member matches the way a group prefix does: the exact dotted key, or that key plus
// a dot, so a whole subtree can be named by its parent.

// Hiding a key from the FORM is only half of it: the JSON pane (#785) holds the whole candidate,

// candidate the view carries is a PROJECTION of the fetched config — the underscore metadata
// dropped (`_core_keys` and friends are display directives, not configuration) and every hidden
// path dropped with it.
//
// The projection copies every plain object on the way down, not the aliased slice the view used
// to build inline. The form edits the candidate in place, so sharing objects with the fetched
// config let a field edit rewrite `cfg` too — and `cfg` is what the "a blanked secret returns to
// the sentinel the server sent" recovery reads back out of. ARRAYS ride by reference, not copied
// (`isPlainObject` excludes them) — safe only while nothing edits an array member in place.

// machine with SSH on would turn it off. Every hidden subtree therefore comes back from
// `source`, the config the server sent, and `source` wins: a hidden key hand-typed into the
