# Everything that makes an unpacked rootfs into a bootable pithead slot.
#
# Sourced by BOTH mkimage.sh (initial slot A) and mkbundle.sh (the slot image inside an update
# bundle). It exists because those two started out as separate copies of the same steps and drifted:
# the bundle never wrote /etc/fstab, so slot B came up with a read-only root and no writable /var
# and could not boot. RAUC installed it perfectly and GRUB selected it correctly — the slot itself
# was simply unbootable. Anything a slot needs goes here, once, or the two paths drift again.
#
# Rugix needs no equivalent: its bakery builds the image and the bundle from one layer definition,
# so there is no second copy to keep in sync.

# Resolve the RAUC signing material into RAUC_CERT / RAUC_KEY, and decide whether auto-generating a
# throwaway is allowed. Both mkimage.sh and mkbundle.sh route through here so the rule is enforced
# once: the cert this returns becomes the device trust root (mkimage bakes it as the keyring) and
# the key signs update bundles (mkbundle). Getting it wrong ships a fleet whose update trust root
# is a throwaway dev key with no offline backup and no revocation — so the guard, not human memory
# of a runbook, is what separates a release key from whatever cert happens to sit on the build host.
#
#   $1 = 1 for an explicitly-marked dev/bench build (auto-generation allowed), 0 otherwise.
#
# A release build (the default, $1=0) MUST name the signing key explicitly: PITHEAD_RAUC_CERT +
# PITHEAD_RAUC_KEY. A dev build with no key named auto-generates a clearly-labelled CN=pithead-dev
# throwaway into os/rauc/certs/ (chmod 600 key, 700 dir). The two paths never cross — a release
# build refuses to run without an explicit key, so a dev cert can never silently become the fleet's
# update trust root. Custody of the real release key: docs/dev/release-server.md.
#
# Trust anchor vs. signer are separate axes. RAUC_KEYRING is the cert(s) baked into every slot as
# the device trust anchor; RAUC_CERT/RAUC_KEY are the leaf that signs the bundle. For a root+leaf
# release, set PITHEAD_RAUC_KEYRING to the root (or old+new roots concatenated during a rotation)
# and PITHEAD_RAUC_CERT to the leaf chain. It defaults to the signing cert, which is the single
# self-signed cert the dev model uses.
