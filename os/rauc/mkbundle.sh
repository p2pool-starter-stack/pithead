#   PITHEAD_MIN_OS_VERSION=X.Y.Z — the lowest OS version that can still read /data once it has.
# A migrating release MUST name that floor: without it a later rollback silently strands the
# migrated chain data (os-update reads the floor back to refuse exactly that).
# The stamped version is ALWAYS the checkout's VERSION, and deliberately has no override. The
# manifest version and the version the payload actually ships must agree: pithead-boot judges an
# update by comparing the in-flight target to the booted slot's VERSION file, and STACK_VERSION is
# derived from that same file and tags every first-party image. A bundle whose manifest disagreed
# with its payload would report a rollback that never happened, and one whose payload was rewritten
# to agree would hunt image tags that were never published. Both were tried; both broke. Anything
# that wants a version delta changes what the TARGET is running, not what the bundle claims.
