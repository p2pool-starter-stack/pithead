# Does build/tor/healthcheck.sh still run on nothing but the commands its own image ships?
#
# The #1098 guard (scripts/lint/verify-healthcheck-scripts.sh) asks whether a healthcheck script EXISTS
# where its Dockerfile promises. This asks the other half of the same contract: whether that script
# can still RUN there. #1372 is the case that made the gap visible — build/tor/Dockerfile installed
# `xxd` by name purely for healthcheck.sh's one call site, which bought vim's CVE stream for a
# command Alpine's busybox already provides. Nothing in CI could see either the need or its removal.
#
# It is an ALLOWLIST, not a denylist: a dependency nobody declared fails here, rather than passing
# because nobody thought to ban it. Widening HC_CMDS is the point at which someone has to check the
# image really ships the new command.
#
# NAMED GAP, deliberately not approximated: this cannot prove the IMAGE's `xxd` behaves — the host's
# is vim's, the very package #1372 removed. That the pinned digest's busybox provides an `xxd` applet
# taking the same `-p -c 256` was proven inside the image on #1372, and is guarded by nothing but the
# base-image pin. What IS proven here is the script's dependency set and its logic.
#
# It lives beside the script it tests, like entrypoint.sh and healthcheck.sh live beside the
# Dockerfile, and is never COPY'd into the image — the Dockerfile copies named files only. It takes
# `--self-test` with no other mode, matching every other entry in the harness registry that drives
# it (tests/stack/test-harness-tooling.sh).
