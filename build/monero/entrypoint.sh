# Optional clearnet initial sync (#183). DEFAULT OFF. For the fast clearnet sync window only, this
# makes monerod match the connectivity P2Pool v4.18 recommends for a clearnet node:
#   - strip the single `proxy=` line that forces ALL P2P over Tor → monerod dials its compiled-in
#     clearnet seed nodes (and the priority nodes below) directly, at clearnet speed instead of
#     crawling over bandwidth-capped Tor circuits.
#   - out-peers → 32 (P2Pool v4.18's clearnet recommendation; the Tor render uses 48, a circuit-
#     bandwidth workaround). in-peers stays 64 — the open-files cap, which is the rec we always honor.
#   - add P2Pool's recommended priority nodes for guaranteed-good peers + block templates. These are
#     CLEARNET hostnames, so they're added ONLY here: in Tor mode their resolution would leak a
#     clearnet DNS lookup tied to this host's IP (#161). Connections still arrive over clearnet,
#     which is exactly the exposure this opt-in window already accepts.
# `tx-proxy=tor,...` is LEFT IN PLACE so transaction broadcast stays on Tor (tx-origin privacy
# preserved) — and there's no tx broadcast during a sync anyway. The DNS blocklist / DNS
# checkpointing the rec also lists are MINING-time protections (bad-node bans, selfish-mining
# defense) that don't apply to a download-only sync; in Tor mining mode they'd leak DNS (#161), so
# we keep them off and rely on monerod's compiled-in checkpoints. The Tor render (the untouched
# template) restores every private default the moment the dashboard flips back.
# Kept as a function (portable sed, no in-place -e) so the shell test suite can exercise it directly.
