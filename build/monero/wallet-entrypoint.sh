#
# Runs monero-wallet-rpc against the LOCAL monerod, scan-only: the wallet is generated from the
# operator's PRIVATE VIEW KEY with NO spend key, so it can see incoming payouts but CANNOT
# spend. The view key is written to a JSON file on tmpfs and handed to --generate-from-json — it is
# NEVER put on the command line, where `docker inspect` / `ps` would expose it (#90 discipline,
# same as monerod's RPC creds). First run creates the wallet from keys at PAYOUT_SCAN_HEIGHT; later
# runs reopen the existing wallet file from the named volume.
