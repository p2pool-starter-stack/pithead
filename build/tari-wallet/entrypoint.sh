# View-only Tari payout-confirmation wallet (#462), the sibling of #381's monero wallet-rpc.
#
# Runs minotari_console_wallet against the LOCAL Tari base node, scan-only: the wallet is created
# from the operator's PRIVATE VIEW KEY + PUBLIC SPEND KEY (with a password that only encrypts the
# local DB), so it can SEE incoming merge-mine coinbase payouts but CANNOT spend.
#
# SECRET HANDLING (the deliberate deviation from #381): Tari has no JSON-import path, so the three
# secrets can't ride a file handed to a create-from-json flag. They also must NOT sit in the
# container's `environment:` — `docker inspect` would show them. Instead compose delivers them as a
# `secrets:` entry, which Docker mounts on a TMPFS at $SECRET_FILE (/run/secrets/...), owner-readable
# only. This wrapper sources that file and EXPORTS the three MINOTARI_WALLET_* vars into the wallet
# child process only — they never appear in the container's declared env, so `docker inspect` never
# sees them, and they never touch argv (where `ps` would expose them). First run creates the
# view-only wallet from the keys; later runs reopen the existing wallet DB from the named volume.
