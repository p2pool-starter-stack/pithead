# Pithead Tari entrypoint wrapper (#183/#234).
#
# pithead renders the canonical *Tor* config (build/tari/config.toml, bind-mounted read-only-ish at
# $TARI_CONFIG_SRC). This wrapper produces the RUNTIME config the node actually uses, then chains to
# the upstream start_tari_app.sh (which honours WAIT_FOR_TOR and the base-path exactly as before).
#
# It NEVER mutates the canonical config — it copies it to a runtime path and, ONLY when an optional
# clearnet initial sync is active, transforms the copy. "Active" = the flag is on AND the dashboard's
# auto-transition marker is absent (#234); once the chain has synced over clearnet the dashboard
# drops that marker and restarts the container, so this start (and every later one) uses the
# untouched Tor config — the node returns to Tor on its own and stays there.
#
# Clearnet transform: flip the transport tor_tcp → tcp, re-enable the seeds.tari.com DNS seed (the
# bundled onion peer_seeds are unreachable without Tor), and stop advertising the onion. The host's
# IP is briefly visible to the Tari P2P network during the sync window.
