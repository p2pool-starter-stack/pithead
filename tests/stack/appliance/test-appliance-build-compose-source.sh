# The compose file an appliance image ships comes from the release it names, not the tree (#1215).
# Every `image:` in docker-compose.yml is pinned by STACK_VERSION, which the appliance derives from
# its baked VERSION, so a tree ahead of that release bakes a compose file assuming image content the
# pinned tags predate (#1098: a healthcheck script the published image did not carry). build-image's
# stage_compose takes the file from the tag `v<VERSION>` when that tag exists, from the tree while
# it does not (the release being prepared), and refuses the one silent case — a clone that has the
# tag on origin but never fetched it. verify-image's compose_reference reads the COMPOSE_SOURCE stamp
# the build writes and resolves the file the shipped one must equal, refusing a stamp that is
# missing, malformed, names another version than the shipped VERSION, or names a commit the
# checkout lacks. Both helpers sit above their script's test seam and are driven here against a
# scratch git repo: no docker, no image, no network (the refuse case's "origin" is a local bare
# repo). Sourced by tests/stack/run.sh.
