# OS-update lock contention (#1482): the appliance's `os-install` verb takes the mutation lock, so
# an install that arrives while another pithead operation holds the machine must come back as
# `rejected` — never as a `failed` install. The distinction is the whole point: "failed" tells an
# operator the install ran and broke, when in fact `rauc install` was never reached and the staged
# bundle is still there to retry. Two sections: a positive control that the fixture arms and an
# uncontended install really does succeed, then the contended case itself.
# Sourced by tests/stack/run.sh.
#
# This lives beside test-appliance-os-update-verbs.sh rather than inside it because that file sits
# at its recorded budget ceiling with zero headroom, and ceilings only go down.
#
# Re-derivations: $SANDBOX, $STACK and the assert_* helpers come from lib.sh; every other name is
# assigned here. Both files are sourced into ONE shell by run.sh, so nothing here reuses a name the
# verbs file defines — its $OSC/$OSDIR/$OSRES/$UOS and osrun/os_intent/os_reset are deliberately
# untouched, and this file's are $OSL/$OSLDIR/$OSLRES/$ULOCK and oslrun/osl_intent. Every write
# lands under $OSL ($SANDBOX/os-lock): nothing touches $V, $C or the ambient $STACK sandbox, and
# nothing outside this file reads what it creates.
