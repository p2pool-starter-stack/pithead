# Appliance identity domain (#1105 Phase 1, appliance lane): who the appliance says it is, and
# everything the machine derives from that answer. The browsable name a headless setup resolves —
# never the bare hostname, which served a name no LAN client could look up; the ssh access derived
# from it, key-only and /run-resident, absent when disabled and refused outright when enabled with
# no key (#786); the control-runner units rendered into /run because the appliance's root is
# read-only (#791); and the TLS certificate that has to agree with the name list Caddy actually
# serves — that it exists whenever the Caddyfile names it, that its SAN list and Caddy's site list
# agree for a given identity (#1132), that appliance_site_names stays engine-free while the live
# check excludes proxy_net's gateway, that check_appliance_cert warns rather than fails when the
# engine cannot be asked, that it re-mints when the served names change and not otherwise, and
# that a wiped wizard spool re-arms so a retry keeps its TLS rather than making the console's
# printed fingerprint a lie (#1063).
# Sourced by tests/stack/run.sh.
#
# The block is contiguous and its source stanza sits at its exact former position, so execution
# order is unchanged — a pure relocation, not a regrouping.
#
# Taken deliberately, and worth naming because it is the one arguable member: the control-runner
# units rendering into /run (#791). Its topical neighbours — provision_control_runner's ownership
# and foreign-install guards — live in tests/stack/control/test-control-provisioning.sh, so a reader looking
# for control-runner work will find most of it there. It travels here because it is a consequence of
# the appliance's read-only root rather than of the control channel, and because it sits inside the
# contiguous run: excluding it would buy a tidier topic at the cost of the property that makes this
# cut cheap, namely that nothing executes in a different order afterwards. If a reviewer disagrees,
# moving it to a control file later is independent of this cut and costs one range.
#
# Left behind, deliberately: preflight_remote_nodes' dial-before-commit check, which follows this
# block and reads as identity-adjacent because provisioning is what consumes both. It belongs to
# the remote-node contract, not to who the machine is.
#
# `$WALLET` is read below and is not this file's to assume. lib.sh's two sandbox builders default it
# (build_val_sandbox, build_control_sandbox), and neither is called from here — so in the suite it
# survives only because an earlier run.sh section happened to build a sandbox first. Sourcing in
# place preserves that accident, which is why the suite is green with or without this line. Seed it
# from the same constant those builders use, so the file states its own dependency rather than
# inheriting one; `:-` keeps a caller's value, so nothing in the suite changes.
