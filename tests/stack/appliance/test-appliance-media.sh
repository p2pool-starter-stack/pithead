# Appliance media domain (#1105 Phase 1, appliance lane): the physical-presence config channel
# (#786 sub-issue D) — a FAT stick carrying pithead-config.json, consumed on the boot leg by
# os/overlay/pithead-media-config. Nine sections cover removable-partition discovery, finding and
# merging the staged file (settings the stick does not name keep their running values), validating
# it through the same engine the pre-seed path uses, the masked diff that still shows the wallet in
# full, the abort/apply confirm gate with no real 60s wait, consuming the file off the medium
# (deleted, never renamed), and main()'s identical-config short-circuit against a real apply.
# Sourced by tests/stack/run.sh.
#
# The block is contiguous and its source stanza sits at its exact former position, so execution
# order is unchanged — a pure relocation, not a regrouping.
#
# Re-derivations: none. $SANDBOX, $ROOT and the VALID_* address fixtures come from lib.sh; every
# other name is assigned here — $MC and the seven $STICK* trees beneath it, $RUN_CFG, $MOUNT_SRC,
# $MOUNT_LOG — and the media_* and _secret_paths_json functions come from
# $ROOT/os/overlay/pithead-media-config, which each section sources for itself rather than relying
# on an ambient one. Every write in the file lands under $MC ($SANDBOX/media-config): nothing
# touches the ambient $V, $C or $STACK, and nothing outside this file reads what it creates.
