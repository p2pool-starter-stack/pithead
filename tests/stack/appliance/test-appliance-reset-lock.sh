# Reset-verb lock wiring (#1482): factory-reset, config-reset and reset-dashboard each take the
# mutation lock, and take it in the one place that is correct. Sourced by tests/stack/run.sh.
#
# SCOPE, stated so this is not read as duplicating test-lifecycle.sh. That file proves the lock
# MECHANISM — the holder record, the announced wait, the refusal, the rc, the release — driven
# through `stack_down`. None of it says whether any OTHER verb is wired to that mechanism, and the
# three reset verbs were not: they mutated the machine holding nothing. So what is asserted here is
# WIRING and PLACEMENT, one verb at a time, and nothing about how the lock itself behaves. The rc
# assertions are the cheapest proof that a verb reaches mutation_lock_acquire at all, not a second
# opinion on the exit status.
#
# PLACEMENT is the half a plain "does it take the lock" test would miss, and it is pinned from both
# sides. Before the first mutation: on a held machine each verb must leave config.json, the ESP
# marker, the containers and the data directories exactly as it found them, because the refusal
# tells the operator nothing was changed and that has to be literally true. After the confirmation:
# a verb given the wrong confirmation word on a held machine must abort on the word, not sit in the
# lock wait — the hold must never span a human wait. Move the acquire past the first mutation and
# the first group fails; move it above the prompt and the second does.
#
# Every case runs against a POSITIVE CONTROL that the same fixture, uncontended, really does perform
# the mutation being looked for. Without that, "config.json is still here" is equally consistent with
# a fixture that never armed — and the two read identically.
#
# This lives beside test-appliance-reset.sh rather than inside it because tests/stack ceilings only
# go down, and the sibling-file shape is the one #1514 established for the os-install half of #1482.
#
# Re-derivations: $SANDBOX, $STACK, make_stubs, bad and the assert_* helpers come from lib.sh; every
# other name is assigned here, under an RSL/rsl_ prefix chosen because test-lifecycle.sh already
# owns $RL and both files are sourced into ONE shell. Unlike its sibling this file needs no $WALLET
# seed: config-reset only checks that config.json EXISTS before removing it, and the other two verbs
# never read it, so no case here writes a wallet address of any kind.
