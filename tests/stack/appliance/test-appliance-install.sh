# Appliance install domain (#1105 Phase 1, appliance lane): getting Pithead onto a machine, and
# what the next install reads back off the one before it. The installer gate retries a device
# probe that has not settled yet, so a reinstall boot does not fall through into setup mode; the
# installation medium's pre-seeded config and the ESP's wipe note are read as input rather than
# truth, and published to the wizard's spool; the appliance refuses the plain-tarball upgrade path
# a host install would take; consume_install_request validates a browser-supplied disk target on
# the host side; and the reinstall pre-fill strips every secret class before publishing the
# remainder, failing open when there is no previous install to read.
# Sourced by tests/stack/run.sh.
#
# Shape: one contiguous run plus one island. The source stanza sits at the contiguous run's exact
# former position, so all but the island execute exactly where they did. The island is the
# installer-gate section, which moves later in the order; it is safe to move because it is closed
# over itself — it builds its own mktemp tree, sources $STACK inside a subshell rather than
# relying on an ambient definition, and removes the tree and unsets its names before it ends, so
# nothing between its old position and its new one can observe that it ran.
#
# Left behind, deliberately, and this one is a coupling finding rather than a taste call: the
# host-installer cluster (install.sh's host gate, its fails-closed download verification, and the
# uninstall counterpart) is topically the strongest install content in the suite and is NOT
# takeable today. Those sections read $V, $WALLET and seed_env, none of which lib.sh defines at
# top level — they exist only as a side effect of build_val_sandbox() having been called, and the
# calls that satisfy them live in sibling domain files that run.sh happens to source earlier.
# The download-verification section additionally reads $REL, which leaks out of test-release.sh
# the same way, and it spans four other domains' source stanzas, so moving it would relocate
# where those domains load. Taking that cluster would either import a cross-file source-order
# dependency or require re-deriving the shared validation sandbox, and re-deriving it resets a
# tree that sections still in run.sh are using. It needs its own change, with that coupling
# addressed on purpose, not a move cut that inherits it quietly.
#
# Also left behind: load_baked_images, whose own comment names pithead-boot and the first-boot
# wizard as its owners; reinstall_prefill_verdict, which belongs with the boot-time verdict
# helpers it sits among rather than with the pre-fill it reports on; and the boot mechanics
# already promised to the appliance-boot cut.
#
# Re-derivations: none, and that is checkable rather than asserted — every name this file uses
# that it does not assign itself resolves in lib.sh. $SANDBOX, $STACK, $VALID_PRIMARY and
# $VALID_TARI are lib.sh top-level assignments, and run_sourced, ok, bad, assert_eq,
# assert_contains and assert_rc are lib.sh functions. Nothing here reads the shared validation or
# control sandboxes, writes the ambient .env or Caddyfile, or leaves state behind: each section
# builds its own mktemp tree and unsets its names as it ends. The PITHEAD_* names a section drives
# its subject with go two ways, and the assignment form decides which — one riding as a command
# prefix never enters this shell, while one exported standalone persists and is unset with the
# rest of that section's state. Read the form in front of you rather than the prefix of the name.
