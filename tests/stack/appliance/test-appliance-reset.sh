# Appliance reset domain (#1105 Phase 1, appliance lane): the two-tier reset, and the boot-time
# wipe that carries out its heavier half. config-reset clears the operator's configuration and the
# rendered files that came from it while leaving the chain data alone, because re-running setup must
# not cost a resync; factory-reset does not wipe anything itself but arms a marker the next boot
# acts on, and refuses outright anywhere that is not an appliance. pithead-data-reset is that next
# boot: it decides reformat-versus-skip fail-safe, so a wedged /data can be recovered without a
# healthy one ever being destroyed by a misread, it leaves evidence behind that the wipe really
# happened rather than reporting success from a no-op (#1062), and it resolves the partition to
# operate on by PARTLABEL on the disk actually booted from, never by a bare label that a second
# disk could answer for (#926). Sourced by tests/stack/run.sh.
#
# $WALLET IS SEEDED BELOW — do not delete it as redundant. The config-reset section writes a
# config.json and reads $WALLET to do it, but nothing in this file calls either sandbox builder.
# lib.sh sets WALLET only inside build_val_sandbox and build_control_sandbox, as a defaulted
# assignment, which retires the coupling for anything that CALLS a builder and does nothing at all
# for anything that does not. This file calls neither, so without the seed it cannot be sourced on
# its own under set -u. The seed defaults, so an ambient value still wins, and it falls back to
# lib.sh's checksum-valid dummy — never a real address.
#
# Three names look like the same hazard on a first pass and are not. $VALID_PRIMARY — the fallback
# in the seed line above — and $VALID_TARI, which sits on the same printf as $WALLET, are both
# assigned by lib.sh at top level, so they are genuinely ambient and need no seed of their own; the
# way to tell them from $WALLET is where lib.sh assigns the name, not how it reads at the call site.
# $REPAIR_LOG reads as unassigned to a scan anchored at line-start, because it is the second name on
# an export line inside this file — every read of it here is defaulted in any case.
#
# Otherwise: $ROOT, $SANDBOX and $STACK come from the harness as they do for every domain file,
# along with lib.sh's assert_eq, assert_rc, assert_contains and assert_not_contains. The three
# functions the reset decision itself is made of — boot_disk_part, data_reset_decision and
# record_wipe — come from os/overlay/pithead-data-reset, which the sections source for themselves
# before each call rather than inheriting it from anywhere. Every other name is assigned here.
