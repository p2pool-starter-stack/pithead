# Optional .env keys under `set -u` (#1246): generate_caddyfile must DEGRADE when an optional key
# is absent from the sourced .env, not abort the command that sourced it. Sourced by run.sh.
#
# THE DEFECT. `pithead` runs under `set -Eeuo pipefail`. The auth block is optional by design —
# rendered only when a dashboard password is configured — and it was guarded by
# `[ -n "$DASHBOARD_AUTH_HASH_B64" ]`. That guard handles an EMPTY value and crashes on an UNSET
# one, so any .env that legitimately lacks the key turned "render no auth block" into a fatal
# `DASHBOARD_AUTH_HASH_B64: unbound variable` in whatever command sourced it (render/apply/doctor,
# and the rotate-dashboard-onion path at 32-onion-provisioning.sh:209, where it was first seen).
#
# SCOPE, stated so this is not read as a general .env-robustness suite. What is asserted is ONE
# key's absence behaviour on ONE function. It says nothing about whether other keys are optional —
# they are mostly NOT: DASHBOARD_SECURE, HOST_IP and NETWORK_PREFIX are required, and defaulting
# them would convert a loud abort into a silent misconfiguration (for DASHBOARD_SECURE, a silent
# HTTPS-to-HTTP downgrade, since `[ "$DASHBOARD_SECURE" == "true" ]` fails closed to the plaintext
# branch). Their bare reads are deliberate and are not a gap this file is covering for.
#
# THE FIXTURE PROVES ITSELF, which matters more here than usual. A hand-built .env that happened to
# omit some OTHER required key would crash too, and "it crashed" would go green off the wrong key —
# identical failure text across cases that should differ is exactly how that hides. Two guards: the
# absent-key case asserts rc 0 and a NON-EMPTY render, so a second missing key reddens it loudly
# rather than passing; and the mutant cases assert on the KEY NAME in the message, not on rc.
#
# THE MUTANT IS BUILT IN rather than left to a manual pass. #1246 names its own mutation — respell
# the default back off — so this file applies it to a COPY of $STACK, proves the copy really differs
# from the original (a replace that does not match writes an unchanged file and reads as a pass),
# and asserts the copy fails on the absent key and still succeeds on the present one. Without that
# pair the absent-key assertion is equally consistent with a guard that was never load-bearing.
#
# Re-derivations: $SANDBOX, $STACK and the assert_* helpers come from lib.sh. Every other name is
# assigned here under a COE/coe_ prefix — every domain file is sourced into ONE shell, so an
# unprefixed name would collide. coe_render deliberately does NOT reuse lib.sh's run_sourced: that
# helper sources $STACK only, and the whole point of #1246 is the context that sources a partial
# .env FIRST, so the .env step has to be inside the same subshell.
