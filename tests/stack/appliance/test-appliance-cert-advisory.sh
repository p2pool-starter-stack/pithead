# driven with stubs: `apply_refresh_appliance_tls` — the unchanged-config path of `apply` now
# reaches the mint (through generate_caddyfile, idempotent by SAN set) and restarts Caddy only when
# the certificate or the Caddyfile actually moved, so the command doctor prints is true — and
# `gate_cert_advisory` — the boot gate commits a slot held by coverage alone once the narrow
# re-mint could not clear it (render minted nothing, or the budget is spent), recording the drift
# as the verdict's `advisory`. The wiring of both sits below a sourcing boundary or inside `apply`,
# so it is asserted by ORDER in the source and labelled static. Sourced by tests/stack/run.sh.
