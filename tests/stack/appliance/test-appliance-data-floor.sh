# The /data migration floor after a data_migration update that FAILED its gate (#1393). os-update
# raises the floor at install time, before the migration runs; the migration hold (#851) then
# keeps the chain services down until the slot commits, so a slot that fails its gate falls back
# with the data untouched — and, before this, with the floor left raised over it, every later
# os-update below that floor refused with "/data was migrated forward" as fact. Three pieces:
# the raise now records the floor it replaces (or `none`) in `.os-data-floor.prev` BEFORE
# raising; pithead-boot's fallback boot puts the floor back from that record and ONLY from a
# record (with none the floor stays — never lowered without one); and the version guard, on a
# floor above the running version, refuses with the true premise and the open route instead of
# naming a reset. The boot half is a sourceable function driven here with files in a sandbox,
# the same shape as os_update_rollback_verdict; its two call sites sit below the sourcing
# boundary and are asserted by the script's text. Sourced by tests/stack/run.sh.
