# Appliance boot domain (#1105 Phase 1, appliance lane): what an appliance does between power-on
# and a slot it is willing to keep. The baked image store is loaded by archive digest rather than
# by tag, rebuilds itself when an interrupted write leaves it damaged, and narrates a slow load
# without narrating a fast one (#798). pithead-boot then wires the miner leg AFTER the slot commit,
# the A/B commit gate reads doctor --json rather than trusting the curl alone (#852), and the boot
# health probe asks the dashboard's own site and can tell it apart from anything else answering
# (#1140). The verdict helpers that gate the commit are here with it — os_update_rollback_verdict's
# rolled_back case, provable without a KVM boot (#1051), and revenue_container_verdict's honesty
# about syncing versus crashed (#852) — along with pithead-sync's rigforge leg, which replaces the
# program while preserving state and seeding the prebuilt. Last, the two contracts that decide what
# a bad boot is allowed to do: a boot failing its health gate reboots itself once and only once
# (#1065), and the appliance battery's release gate does not lie about what it ran (#1064).
# Sourced by tests/stack/run.sh.
#
# THIS CUT REORDERED, and that is the part worth knowing about it. When the cut was taken the block
# was not contiguous in run.sh: it was three parts, with the appliance-install and rig-miner source
# stanzas between the first and the second, and the kernel, RAUC, mkbundle and reset sections
# between the second and the third. (That describes run.sh as it stood at the cut; later cuts will
# move those neighbours, which is why it is written in the past tense rather than as a claim about
# the file you are reading today.) The source stanza was placed at the MIDDLE part's former
# position, so that part — the largest, and the one carrying the boot-order contracts — kept its
# exact place in the run. The other two moved: the image-store part later, past the two appliance
# domain files, and the health-gate part earlier, ahead of the kernel/RAUC/mkbundle/reset block.
#
# Why that is safe, argued rather than asserted. The image-store part now runs after the two
# appliance domain files instead of before them. It leaks nothing: every variable it sets and every
# helper function it defines is unset as its own section ends, so those domains cannot inherit
# anything from it, and it reads nothing they assign — both extend $PATH per call site as a command
# prefix rather than replacing this shell's, and neither leaves a name behind that this part names.
# The health-gate and release-gate part now runs before the kernel, RAUC, mkbundle and reset
# sections instead of after them. It reads only $ROOT and $SANDBOX, writes only inside its own
# subdirectory, and shares no name with that block in either direction: nothing there reads what
# this part leaves set, and nothing here reads what that block assigns.
#
# That argument is a coupling analysis, so it was checked against the run rather than trusted: the
# before and after suite logs were compared as an ORDERED sequence of section headers, not only as a
# multiset. A sorted multiset destroys order by definition, a header count cannot see a permutation
# and a log-line total cannot either, so those three instruments would pass a cut that shuffled the
# suite arbitrarily. Any later cut that moves a non-contiguous block owes the same ordered check.
#
# Left behind, deliberately: the host-installer cluster — uninstall keeping the operator's files
# and install.sh's host gate (#77 phase 1), and its download verification failing closed (#868).
# Those read names that no longer have an owner in run.sh: they survive only because a sibling
# domain file happens to build a sandbox earlier in the run, and moving them anywhere before that
# accident is retired would carry the accident along. They belong to the standalone-source sweep
# (#1387), not to this cut.
#
# Re-derivations: none, and nothing needed seeding. $ROOT, $SANDBOX and $HERE come from run.sh's
# harness, as they do for every domain file, along with lib.sh's ok, bad, assert_eq,
# assert_contains, assert_not_contains and assert_rc helpers. Every other name is assigned here.
# Two names read as ambient on a first pass and are not: PODMAN_IMAGE_PRESENT is read only in a
# defaulted expansion, so it is safe under set -u whether or not it is set; and BUILT,
# PITHEAD_EXPECT_COMMIT and expect appear only inside single-quoted bodies written out as a
# generated verify script, where they are that script's names rather than reads in this shell.
# A single-quoted body is not a read — check the quoting before believing a coupling.

# update — one that boots cleanly with a dead stack — it did not: pithead-boot left the slot
