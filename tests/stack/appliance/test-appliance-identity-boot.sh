# Appliance identity and boot-provisioning domain (#1105 Phase 1, appliance lane): the overlay
# units that give a freshly imaged machine an identity of its own, and the boot-time work whose
# success a later boot has to be able to prove. pithead-machine-id restores THROUGH
# /etc/machine-id rather than unmounting it first, because on a read-only-root A/B slot the
# unmount exposes the lower image and the write then fails, leaving an empty id and a machine
# that comes back as a stranger. pithead-hugepages sizes the RandomX pool against the machine's
# own RAM and degrades on a small box instead of refusing to boot (#977), with the overlay's pool
# figure, the CLI's PITHEAD_HUGEPAGES and the rootfs's baked sysctl line all held to one value,
# because drift between them re-opens the silent floor that cap was written to close. Then the
# boot verdicts, each of which exists because a simpler check could not tell two different
# histories apart: hugepages_boot_verdict separates a boot where the unit ran and had nothing to
# do from one where it never ran at all (#1212); restore_live_state_verdict demands proof that the
# restored machine is RUNNING what was restored, since config.json sitting on disk is not that
# proof (#1091); reinstall_prefill_verdict refuses to read a matching wallet as evidence of which
# code path produced it (#1038). The rest covers the identity a machine mints for itself and the
# disks it has to find: pithead-ssh-host-keys generates a per-machine host key on /data and only
# once (#894/#980), and pithead-mount-generator follows the BOOTED disk rather than a label, so a
# second disk carrying the same label cannot capture /data or the ESP (#926/#980). os/build-image.sh's
# flag parsing and its 404 remedy hint are proven here too, without a build. All of it is at the
# shell-unit tier: the scripts under test are sourced and called directly inside subshells, with
# no docker and no image build. Sourced by tests/stack/run.sh.
#
# THIS CUT REORDERED, and the reason is worth recording. In run.sh as it stood at the cut, this
# domain's sections were not contiguous: the source stanza for the appliance-media domain file sat
# between the reinstall-prefill verdict and the build-image section. That stanza stayed where it
# was. Moving it would have nested a domain file inside this one, and a nested stanza reassigns
# the same _d0 that the outer stanza passes to domain_ran — which would have narrowed this file's
# zero-assertion guard (#1400) to cover only the part running after the nesting, silently, with
# the suite still green and the moved text still byte-identical. So the cut took two ranges and
# left that stanza out of both, and the source stanza was placed at the machine-id section's
# former position, which keeps the larger part of the domain exactly where it ran before. The
# build-image, ssh-host-keys and mount-generator sections are the ones that moved: they now run
# before the appliance-media domain instead of after it.
#
# Why that is safe, argued rather than asserted, and in both directions. Those three sections
# inherit nothing FROM appliance-media. The only variables they read without assigning are $ROOT
# and $SANDBOX, and the only functions they call without defining are lib.sh's assertion helpers
# and apt_fetch_failure_hint: the variables and the helpers come from tests/stack/lib.sh, which is
# sourced before any domain file is, and apt_fetch_failure_hint comes from os/build-image.sh,
# which the section sources for itself inside the very subshell that calls it. So the domain they
# used to follow supplies none of them. FRESH_INDEX looks like a further such name and is not: it
# is set by os/build-image.sh and read back through a ${..:-} default inside that same subshell.
# And appliance-media inherits nothing FROM them, in either of the two ways it could. It reads no
# variable they assign — the only names it reads without assigning are $ROOT, $SANDBOX,
# $VALID_PRIMARY and $VALID_TARI, all of them lib.sh's, and none of the three relocated sections
# assigns any of the four. And it calls no function they now leave behind: those sections define
# build_image_test, run_hint, shk_run and mg_run at this file's level, and appliance-media calls
# none of those names. Their filesystem footprints are disjoint as well — the relocated sections
# work inside their own $SANDBOX subdirectories and one probe path that deliberately does not
# exist, while appliance-media works inside its own.
#
# Ambient contract. This file reads $ROOT and $SANDBOX from lib.sh and calls lib.sh's run_sourced
# along with its assertion helpers — assert_eq, assert_rc, assert_contains, assert_not_contains,
# ok and bad. It reads no $WALLET and none of the control-sandbox globals, so it carries no
# self-arm stanza and no seed lines: the moved text is byte-identical to what it replaced, with
# nothing authored inside it. Everything else it needs it sources for itself inside a subshell —
# os/overlay/pithead-hugepages for its pool figure, its sizing helper and its own entry point,
# tests/os/hugepages-boot-verdict.sh, tests/os/restore-live-state-verdict.sh and
# tests/os/reinstall-prefill-verdict.sh for the three verdict functions, and os/build-image.sh for
# its argument handling and remedy hint — so none of those reaches this file as ambient state.
# lib.sh alone is therefore the whole of this file's contract, and that is measured rather than
# asserted: sourcing lib.sh and then this file under set -u, with no run.sh in the picture, runs
# the domain to completion with no failures. Sourcing it WITHOUT lib.sh records no assertion at
# all — it stops inside the first section, at the first read of $SANDBOX, and the whole shell
# exits there rather than carrying on, because that read sits at the file's top level and not
# inside a subshell. The run ends non-zero. Read the message and the stop position, not the exit
# code: on this bash an unbound variable under set -u and a missing command both exit 127, so the
# code on its own cannot tell the two apart.
