# Appliance kernel and OS-image build domain (#1105 Phase 1, appliance lane): the guards that
# stand between a build host and a slot the fleet would be wrong to trust. optimize_kernel's
# HugePages write is grow-only, because with a co-located miner the pool has a single writer that
# sizes it upward, and pithead writing its own absolute figure on top would shrink a grown pool to
# the in-use floor and starve whichever side restarts next; the degrade cap (#977) is proven with
# it. The os/rauc stale-tarball guard covers the failure where a present-but-stale
# os/build/pithead-root.tar is indistinguishable from a fresh one to a size test — a bench deploy
# once bundled a leftover tarball and every downstream check came up green with the old code still
# running — so verify_tarball_commit reads the tarball's own BUILD_COMMIT stamp and compares it to
# the working tree. mkbundle's compatibility-metadata validation refuses a malformed data-migration
# field, and a missing or non-semver migration floor, before the multi-minute image build rather
# than after it. Last, resolve_signing_material: a release build must name its signing key, and
# only an explicitly-marked --dev build may auto-generate a throwaway, so that a dev cert a build
# host happened to have lying around can never become the fleet's update trust root. All of it is
# proven at the shell-unit tier — sourced and called directly, no docker and no loop image build.
# Sourced by tests/stack/run.sh.
#
# THIS CUT REORDERED, by one section, and the reason is worth recording. In run.sh as it stood at
# the cut, this domain's sections were not contiguous: the source stanzas for the os-update and
# os-update-verbs domain files sat between the HugePages section and the RAUC/mkbundle/signing
# block. Those stanzas stayed where they were. Moving them would have nested two domain files
# inside this one, and a nested stanza reassigns the same _d0 that the outer stanza passes to
# domain_ran — which would have narrowed this file's zero-assertion guard (#1400) to cover only
# the part of the file running after the nesting, silently, with the suite still green and the
# moved text still byte-identical. So the cut took two ranges and left those stanzas out of both,
# and the source stanza was placed at the RAUC/mkbundle/signing block's former position, keeping
# the larger part of the domain exactly where it ran before. The HugePages section is the one that
# moved: it now runs after the os-update and os-update-verbs domains instead of before them.
#
# Why that is safe, argued rather than asserted, in both directions. Nothing can be inherited FROM
# the HugePages section by the domains it now follows: it builds its whole world inside a private
# mktemp sandbox, and unsets every variable and function it defined — the sandbox, the call log and
# the runner — as its own section ends, leaving nothing for them to read. And it inherits nothing
# FROM them: the only names it reads without assigning are $ROOT and $STACK, and the assertion
# helpers it calls — variables and functions alike coming from tests/stack/lib.sh, which is sourced
# before any domain file is, so neither of the two domains it now follows supplies any of them.
# It reaches optimize_kernel by sourcing
# $STACK inside a subshell rather than by relying on an earlier section having done so.
#
# Ambient contract. This file reads $ROOT and $STACK from lib.sh and calls lib.sh's assertion
# helpers. It reads no $WALLET and none of the control-sandbox globals, so it carries no self-arm
# stanza and no seed lines: the moved text is byte-identical to what it replaced, with nothing
# authored inside it. RAUC_CERT, RAUC_KEY and RAUC_KEYRING are read only through ${..:-} defaults
# and are outputs of the resolver under test, so they cannot trip set -u either. lib.sh alone is
# therefore the whole of this file's contract, and that is measured rather than asserted: sourcing
# lib.sh and then this file under set -u, with no run.sh in the picture, runs the domain to
# completion with no failures. Sourcing it WITHOUT lib.sh records no assertion at all: every helper
# is command-not-found from the first section onward, and the run ends non-zero.
# Note what it does NOT do — it does not halt at the first error. This file sets no -e, and the
# $ROOT reads that set -u does object to sit inside subshells, so the failure kills the subshell and
# the parent keeps going to the end. The negative half is what makes the positive half a test rather
# than a claim, and it discriminates on whether any assertion ran at all, not on where it stopped.
