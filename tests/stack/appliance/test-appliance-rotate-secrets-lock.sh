# rotate-secrets lock wiring (#1482): the rotate-secrets verb takes the mutation lock, and takes it
# in the one place that is correct. Sourced by tests/stack/run.sh.
#
# SCOPE, stated so this is not read as duplicating its two neighbours. test-lifecycle.sh proves the
# lock MECHANISM — the holder record, the announced wait, the refusal, the rc, the release — driven
# through `stack_down`, and says nothing about which verbs are wired to it. test-secrets.sh proves
# what rotate-secrets DOES — the three credentials it regenerates, what it skips, the safety copies,
# the failure path — and says nothing about mutual exclusion. What is asserted here is WIRING and
# PLACEMENT for this one verb, and nothing about how the lock itself behaves. The rc assertions are
# the cheapest proof that the verb reaches mutation_lock_acquire at all, not a second opinion on the
# exit status.
#
# PLACEMENT is the half a plain "does it take the lock" test would miss, and it is pinned from both
# sides. Before the first mutation: on a held machine the verb must leave config.json's stored RPC
# password, the rendered .env, and the containers exactly as it found them, and must write no
# pre-rotation safety copies — because the refusal tells the operator nothing was changed and that
# has to be literally true. Note that the safety copies, not the credential rewrite, are this verb's
# first write to disk, so they are the assertion that actually pins the acquire's lower bound. After
# the confirmation: a declined rotate on a held machine must come back on the ANSWER, not sit in the
# lock wait — the hold must never span a human wait. Move the acquire past the safety copies and the
# first group fails; move it above the prompt and the second does.
#
# Every contended case runs against a POSITIVE CONTROL that the same fixture, uncontended, really
# does perform the mutation being looked for. Without that, "the token is unchanged" is equally
# consistent with a fixture that never armed — and the two read identically.
#
# This lives beside test-secrets.sh rather than inside it because tests/stack ceilings only go down
# and that file sits at its own (401), and the sibling-file shape is the one #1514/#1528 established
# for the other halves of #1482.
#
# Re-derivations: $SANDBOX, $STACK, $ROOT, $VALID_PRIMARY, $VALID_TARI, make_stubs, run_sourced, bad
# and the assert_* helpers come from lib.sh. Every other name is assigned here, under an RS/rs_
# prefix, because this file and its neighbours are sourced into ONE shell — $V (build_val_sandbox's
# shared sandbox) is deliberately NOT reused: the contended cases assert on the ABSENCE of
# config.json.bak-* files, which would otherwise depend on another domain file's cleanup.
#
# The seeding `apply` below always runs against the FREE lock file, never the held one: `apply` takes
# the window itself, so seeding through a held lock would block rather than set the fixture up.
