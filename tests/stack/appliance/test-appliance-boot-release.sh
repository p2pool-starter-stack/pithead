# The post-commit release of the held chain services retries, keeps its order, and alerts (#1684).
# A data_migration update boots with the chain services held; once the slot commits, pithead-boot
# releases them with `./pithead up`. On the bench that `up` landed while p2pool — started by the
# held `up` — was mid-stop, compose aborted the WHOLE start on podman's "container state improper",
# and the swallowed failure left every held service down under a dashboard reading `updated`;
# nothing retried short of a reboot a committed appliance has no reason to take. The release is now
# `release_held_chain_services`, above pithead-boot's sourcing boundary and driven here with a
# stubbed `pithead` that fails a scripted number of times: the `up` is retried a bounded number of
# times, the markers go BEFORE the first try, the release line (the tier-4 battery's commit
# boundary) prints BEFORE the first `up`, and the last failure is one named FAULT line on stderr,
# never a failed boot. The call site is below the boundary and asserted by the script's text.
# Sourced by tests/stack/run.sh.
