# Stratum-exposure surface domain (#1772). The exposure CHECK itself — the bind x public-IP x mode
# matrix — is proven in test-doctor.sh and is not re-proven here. What this domain owns is the one
# thing that matrix cannot see: WHO READS THE VERDICT, and what the verdict is therefore allowed to
# say. Since #1736 `control_diag_doctor` runs `doctor --json` and ships every recorded message to
# the dashboard, so this check has two audiences that want different text, and one of them is a
# browser on the network.
#
# TWO CLAIMS, and they fail in opposite directions:
#   1. The doctor arms must not carry the host's public ADDRESS. `bundle_redact_log`
#      (07-support-bundle.sh) is the only redactor on that path and it keys on argv position, the
#      onion shape and the Monero shape -- it has NO IP rule, so nothing downstream removes the
#      value and it has to be absent from the message. (tests/integration/lib.sh's redact() does
#      have one, but that twin guards CI artifact uploads from a self-hosted runner, not this path.)
#   2. The APPLIANCE arm must not prescribe a remedy that operator cannot reach. Neither
#      STRATUM_BIND nor STRATUM_PASSWORD is dashboard-committable -- 42-control-policy-and-host-
#      checks.sh names the stratum password as staying host-only -- so the appliance wording states
#      the diagnosis, gives the one route that exists (the router), and stops.
# The setup console is the deliberate exception and is asserted to KEEP the address: it prints to
# the operator's own terminal on their own host, where the value is what makes the finding
# actionable, and it goes nowhere.
#
# THE ABSENCE CLAIMS NEED THE CONSOLE ROW TO BE MEANINGFUL, which is why it is not merely a nicety.
# "8.8.8.8 does not appear in the doctor output" is satisfied just as well by a broken stub whose
# address never reached ANY output. The console row is the positive control on the same instrument
# in the same file: it proves the stubbed address does reach a surface, so its absence elsewhere is
# a fact about the wording rather than about the fixture.
#
# Standalone-sourceable once tests/stack/lib.sh has been sourced; it builds its own `ip` stub rather
# than borrowing test-doctor.sh's, so neither domain can break the other by reordering.
