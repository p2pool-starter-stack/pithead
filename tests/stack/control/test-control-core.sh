# Control-channel core domain (#1105 Phase 1, appliance lane): the six black-box sections that
# build the control sandbox and drive it. First `apply` — fail-closed when the
# control channel is enabled without a dashboard password, the .env render of the control keys and
# the spool dirs, --dry-run/--porcelain previews that touch no container and leave .env alone, the
# PITHEAD_CONFIG_FILE single-invocation override, #695's contract that a symlink-invoked stack
# renders physical paths, and #556's read-only contract on both legs: the direct CLI leaves
# config.json byte-identical after a preview, and the control path does not rewrite the on-disk
# staged copy either. Then control-run-pending end to end — a valid preview claimed out of the
# spool and staged owner-only, malformed and non-v4 ids discarded with no result written, unknown
# actions and extra request keys rejected, the charset strip that stops a forged action appending a
# second line to the tamper-evidence log, and a commit with its pre-change backup and the re-own
# that keeps the operator able to read what root's apply wrote. Last, #349's audit section reads
# that log back and proves it records changed key NAMES and never a config or secret VALUE.
# Sourced by tests/stack/run.sh.
#
# THIS FILE IS THE CONTROL SANDBOX'S BUILDER SITE, and that is what makes it standalone-sourceable
# under `set -u` rather than position-locked: build_control_sandbox() is called here, in the
# section that has always made that call, so $C, $CTRL_LOG, seed_control_env and control_config
# are established by this file instead of reached back for. Execution order is unchanged — the
# source stanza sits in the position this block vacated, so the builder runs exactly where it did.
# What DID change is who provides the sandbox to the control domains sourced after this one: they
# used to name a section of run.sh, and now they name this file. Their headers say so.
#
# ONE FILE, NOT TWO — a disclosed departure from the #1105 cut map's R12 row, which names
# test-control-apply.sh + test-control-audit.sh with the audit half self-arming. Re-derived at the
# tip, the two halves are one stateful timeline rather than two domains, and the seam the map
# proposes is the one place a split is unsafe:
# - The apply half ends by removing the result and staged files its own #556 control-path leg
#   wrote, and its comment says why: the counters below assume a clean spool. The section that
#   follows asserts the results dir holds exactly one file after a malformed id. That exact count
#   is established by a cleanup that sits across the proposed boundary.
# - An audit half armed with its own builder + seed_control_env + control_config + apply would
#   still satisfy that count sourced alone, because an empty spool yields the same one file — the
#   same number for a different reason than it holds in position. Green standalone and green in
#   position on two different mechanisms is not evidence that the arm reproduces the state; it is
#   the shape where a later change to the apply half reds only the in-position run.
# - A builder-only arm stanza is weaker still. $C is the fixed path under $SANDBOX, the builder's
#   mkdir -p only creates, its copies are static inputs, and seed_control_env/control_config are
#   DEFINED inside it and not called by it — so it binds the names under `set -u` and establishes
#   none of the state the assertions read. It would arm in name only.
# Keeping the timeline in one file retires the ordering dependency instead of documenting it,
# which is what #1105 is for, and it costs nothing: the file is under the budget generator's
# floor, so it takes no tsv row.
#
# Re-derivations, audited over this WHOLE file, this header included, with split-name-audit.py.
# That tool is lane-local and is NOT in this repo, so nothing below rests on it: each claim is
# written to be re-derived here with git and grep alone, and should be treated as a claim to check.
# - $C and $CTRL_LOG are assigned nowhere in tests/stack except inside build_control_sandbox(),
#   which this file calls above its first read of either. Self-provided, not inherited. (Strip
#   comments before the grep, and fire it on a name you know is assigned in several files first —
#   a probe that has never matched is not an instrument.)
# - $WALLET is read by the config renders below and by lib.sh's control_config() closure, and it
#   is assigned at column 1 nowhere: both sandbox builders default it as "${WALLET:-$VALID_PRIMARY}"
#   (#1305). This file's own builder call binds it, so the ordering accident that used to supply it
#   from a far-earlier val-sandbox section is retired here rather than inherited.
# - $SANDBOX and $VALID_TARI are lib.sh top-level constants, assigned at column 1 outside every
#   function. Read-only here.
# - $REQS, $RESULTS, $STAGED and $AUDIT are NOT the builder's — they are assigned in this file, as
#   plain derivations from $C, and the control domains sourced after this one read them from here.
#   That is the one ambient name-flow this cut leaves standing. It is disclosed in those files'
#   headers rather than seeded twice, because a second definition could drift from this one.
# - `line` is bound by `while IFS= read -r line`, not inherited. split-name-audit.py does not model
#   `read -r` and reports it as read-never-assigned — a tool limitation, not a dependency.
