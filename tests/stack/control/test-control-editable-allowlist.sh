# Every key on CONTROL_DASHBOARD_EDITABLE_KEYS must actually round-trip a real preview->commit
# through the approval gate and land in config.json (#522) — not just pass a describe_change unit
# check. Split out of run.sh by #1105 R14; the section's own contract is stated at its header below.
#
# WHY THE CONTROL FAMILY, AND NOT THE CONFIG FAMILY THE CUT MAP GUESSED. The map homed this row
# with the config family on the strength of its subject: it flips config keys and reads them back
# out of config.json. Its FIXTURE says otherwise, and the fixture is what a domain file actually
# has to reproduce. Every assertion here goes through gate_try() against the control channel's
# sandbox and its request/result spool, so this section's dependencies are the control channel's,
# and it is homed with them. The map's row left the target to be decided at cut time by fixture
# affinity; this is that decision, recorded rather than assumed.
#
# AMBIENT BY DESIGN — AND THE REASON IS NOT THAT ARMING WOULD BREAK IT. This file inherits $C,
# $CTRL_LOG and $WALLET from the build_control_sandbox() call a control-family domain file makes
# ahead of it, and re-derives only its own spool path from $C. Calling the builder here would most
# likely be harmless — it creates rather than clears and never touches the control spool — but it
# would add a call that does not exist today, and it would buy nothing, because gate_try() is a
# function defined in another domain file and no arm written here can supply it. The cut that
# changes nothing about what executes is the one whose proof is strongest, so that is the one
# taken; the ambient inheritance is disclosed here instead, which is the shipped
# test-control-add-only-ssrf.sh precedent. $VALID_TARI is a top-level lib.sh constant.
#
# POSITION-LOCKED IN run.sh's SOURCE ORDER, not merely position-preferring. gate_try() and $UUID5
# are defined by test-control-add-only-ssrf.sh and deliberately outlive its source; run.sh sources
# that file immediately ahead of this one. That is the other half of the dependency its own header
# already discloses from its side. The carry-over guard below fails by name rather than silently,
# but it cannot make this file sourceable standalone — a missing gate_try() is loud (command not
# found, then the status assertions fail by name) and that is the honest state of it.
#
# WHAT THE INHERITANCE COSTS, stated so the next cut near here need not re-derive it: the gate_try()
# calls below write result files into the shared control spool, and a control-family file run.sh
# sources AHEAD of this one asserts that spool's exact result count. That assertion runs before this
# section writes anything, so it is untouched while this file stays where run.sh sources it.
#
# CONCURRENCY PROVENANCE, carried across the move because it is exactly what a move loses: this is
# the fork-heavy section — a per-key round-trip, each one a real preview->commit through the spool —
# that the fleet's notes name as the contention point when two suite runs share a box. A concurrent
# pair that reddens like cross-talk should be looked for here first.
