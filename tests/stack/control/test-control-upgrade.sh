# Control-upgrade domain (#1105 Phase 1, module 8): the one-click upgrade verb end to end —
# ordering safety (a failed upgrade never repoints the control-runner units, #1070), the shared
# GitHub release-fetch helper (a spent rate limit read honestly instead of blamed on Tor, #1081/
# #1139), the upgrade verb against a release install (#59), extraction to a fresh version dir
# (#629), and the bundle-signature verification module 6 left behind for this module (#376).
# Sourced by tests/stack/run.sh after lib.sh.
#
# Re-derivation: two spots below need the shared control sandbox $C, "control_config main,
# applied" (source-checkout upgrade refusal; the bundle-signature section's channel-disabled
# tail) — but $C is built by build_control_sandbox() in tests/stack/control/test-control-core.sh, which
# run.sh sources AFTER this file, so there is no ambient sandbox to reach back for at this point
# in the run. Re-derive a fresh, equivalent $C, mirroring the control-core domain's own "dashboard
# control channel (#33)" setup, and define $REQS/$RESULTS the same way (not lib.sh globals; only
# these two are read below).
#
# $WALLET, set explicitly: lib.sh's control_config() closure reads it without ever setting it — it used
# to arrive already set globally, from the config-validation section's far-earlier build_val_sandbox()
# call back when that section was inline in run.sh. Same trap as module 7's onion-report fix:
# $VALID_PRIMARY is what WALLET equals there, and it's always bound. Since FIXED in lib.sh (#1305): both
# sandbox builders default WALLET now, so a future control-sandbox domain file no longer has to set it.
# The line below is kept because it is correct and harmless, not because anything still requires it.
