# Control-runner provisioning domain (#1105 Phase 1, appliance lane): the two sections that prove
# provision_control_runner only ever touches the systemd units belonging to the checkout invoking
# it. The unit names pithead-control.{path,service} are box-global, but a release bench holds
# several checkouts at once — live stack, e2e harness, bundle-smoke temp dirs — so a checkout with
# control disabled used to remove whatever units it found, including the live stack's runner (#33).
# The second half is the install side of the same rule: an existing unit whose ExecStart names a
# foreign directory is left alone and said so, an unparseable ExecStart is left alone, the tool's
# own drifted unit is converged in place, and a bench that wants the steal is given an explicit
# opt-in (#1190).
# Sourced by tests/stack/run.sh.
#
# The block is contiguous and its source stanza sits at its exact former position, so execution
# order is unchanged — a pure relocation, not a regrouping.
#
# THIS FILE IS STANDALONE-SOURCEABLE, and that is the correct call here — the OPPOSITE of the
# spool-audit / confirm-approval disclosure precedent, which a reviewer coming from R9 will reach
# for first. Those files are pure CONSUMERS of the shared control sandbox and are position-locked
# by what a sibling section accumulated. This domain is not: it never calls build_control_sandbox
# (grepped: zero in this file, one in test-control-core.sh, where R12 moved the builder call
# out of run.sh), it reads nothing under $C/$RESULTS/$STAGED/$AUDIT,
# and every fixture it needs it builds itself under its own two trees. Run out of position it
# would still assert exactly what it asserts here.
#
# Re-derivations. $SANDBOX and $STACK come from lib.sh, both assigned at COLUMN 1 at top level,
# outside every function body — so neither is the ordering dependency the $WALLET case turned out
# to be. (Re-derive by reading the indent in lib.sh, not by line number.) Every other name is assigned here: $PCR
# and $PCI (the two scratch trees), the pcr_run/pci_run helpers, and $out. Provider functions
# called: assert_contains, assert_eq, assert_not_contains. A word-boundary sweep of all of
# tests/stack/ finds $PCR and $PCI only inside this file — nothing else in the suite reads what
# it creates. (Use a word boundary: a bare $PCR pattern also matches $PCR791 in
# test-appliance-identity.sh, which is a different variable, not a coupling.)
