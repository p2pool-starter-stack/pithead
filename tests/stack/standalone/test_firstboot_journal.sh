# Tier-1 proof for #1030: a first boot interrupted mid-image-load must leave a record that
# survives the reset, not silence. Two pieces, proven separately (the KVM battery is where a
# real hard reset and a real read-only root would prove the whole chain end to end — see
# tests/os/hugepages-boot-verdict.sh for the sibling shape of that split):
#
#   1. os/overlay/pithead-journal-persist: the /data-backed bind mount that gives journald's
#      already-declared Storage=persistent somewhere real to write, so the journal is still
#      there to read after a reset (tests/os/verify-image.sh separately asserts the unit and
#      its ordering are baked into a built image — this proves the SCRIPT's own logic).
#   2. load_baked_images' new "Finished loading ... in Ns" line: the bracket the existing
#      heartbeat (#1028) was missing — a journal with a start line and no matching finish line,
#      for the archive that was loading, is now itself the record of what a mid-load interrupt
#      hit.
