# Tier-1 proof that pithead-data-reset repairs REAL damage before it will ever decide to
# reformat (#1062). run.sh's decision-tree block drives data_reset_decision with stubbed
# repair tools that model their contracts — the right way to prove marker precedence and
# escalation order, and constitutionally unable to prove the repair itself: a stub's verdict
# proves the stub (#1086). Here the filesystem, the damage, and the repair tools are real.
# The image is a genuine ext4 filesystem, the corruption is the same two-byte superblock-magic
# wipe the tier-4 battery injects, and fsck/e2fsck/mke2fs are the system binaries the product
# runs. Only mount is stubbed — mounting needs root — and its verdict comes from the
# filesystem itself (`e2fsck -fn`: succeed only when the filesystem is genuinely clean),
# never from a counter.
#
# The image is 600 MiB, sparse, so it costs a few MiB of real disk. The size is load-bearing:
# below 512 MiB mke2fs's usage-type heuristic switches to 1 KiB blocks, and the geometry
# `mke2fs -n` computes for backup_superblocks() no longer matches what mkfs.ext4 wrote. No
# real /data — it holds two chains — is anywhere near that small, and staying above the
# threshold keeps the product's own derivation honest against this image.
