# Tier-1 proof for #1103: a reduced-RAM appliance must not co-locate the built-in RigForge
# miner with a headroom declaration that double-counts the stack's own HugePages reservation.
#
# tests/stack/run.sh already proves render_local_miner_config's DERIVATION (pool URL, secret,
# the full/released headroom values) — this file is a sibling, not a duplicate: it proves the
# NEW #1103 gate that sits in front of that derivation, so it lives on its own rather than
# growing a file mid-split (#1105 Phase 1). See tests/os/hugepages-boot-verdict.sh /
# os/overlay/pithead-hugepages for where the marker this gate reads comes from — a real KVM
# boot on reduced -m proves the marker itself; this proves what pithead does once it exists.
#
# The math this exists to stop. RigForge's grow-only write is target = current + required - avail,
# and avail excludes pages the stack already holds. On the REDUCED tier (2560 pages, sized for the
# stack's own two RandomX datasets with no co-resident miner in the budget) any nonzero extra_mb the
# render declares is added to required while the same pages are subtracted from avail — counted
# twice. No declared value bounds it, so the fix refuses co-location on exactly that tier: the
# RELEASED tier (0 pages) already declares zero headroom and has nothing to double-count, and the
# FULL tier is the measured, supported case — neither changes.
#
# CORRECTED (#1103 step 2): the formula this header used to quote —
# `1168*numa + 128 + threads + 10 + (extra_mb+1)/2` — is not one of rigforge's, it MERGES two of
# them. util/proposed-grub.sh at the pinned commit has a 1G-page branch
# (`128 + THREADS + 10 + EXTRA`) and a pure-2MB FALLBACK (`1168*NUMA + THREADS + 50 + EXTRA`), and
# the appliance always takes the FALLBACK because it reserves no 1G pages. The correct figure is
# 1168 + 6 + 50 + 3072 = 4296 pages on the supported X5690; it reproduces both measured landings
# exactly (the 16 GiB guest reads THREADS 32 rather than 6 and lands on 4322 — a KVM artifact).
#
# AND THE ~12 GiB ESTIMATE IS NO LONGER AN ESTIMATE: leg B measured the reduced tier with the
# refusal lifted by hand. RigForge requested 6146 pages (12.0 GiB) on a 7.76 GiB box, the kernel
# granted 2916, MemAvailable fell to ~40 MB, and RigForge exited 0 "Deployment Complete" — a 6.3 GiB
# shortfall that nothing on the box reports. Evidence: ~/appliance-suite-logs/1103/RESULTS.md.
