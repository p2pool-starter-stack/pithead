# Tier-1 proof for #1050: three of the four dashboard OS-update dead-end states. The fourth
# (the idle modal offering Download before any check has run) was already fixed by f617dee and
# is covered by dashboard/tests/frontend/osupdate.test.mjs's "Download with only a
# passive badge..." tests — not repeated here.
#
# tests/stack/run.sh already drives the whole check -> download -> verify -> install -> reboot
# chain end-to-end through the real control-file/subprocess door (the "black-box: control
# os-update verbs" block). This file is a sibling that calls the three fixed functions
# DIRECTLY (run_sourced), the same way the render_local_miner_config unit tests do, so it lives
# on its own rather than growing a file mid-split (#1105 Phase 1). It proves the three specific
# regressions the issue reported, not the whole flow again.
