# Rig/worker domain (#1105 Phase 1, appliance lane): the merge-mining rig's stratum-facing
# surface and the control channel's per-rig worker-config/worker-upgrade verbs — xmrig-proxy's
# stratum auth + donate-level knobs (#152/#173), the co-located built-in miner's opt-in announce
# of the pool URL + stratum secret to a RigForge install (#593), stratum-over-TLS render and the
# cert lifecycle a rig pins its fingerprint to (#261), and the worker-config/worker-upgrade verbs
# end to end — fail-closed resolution from the HOST's config.json only, never the intent
# (#185/#597), the accept/poll/terminal state machine against a stubbed rig control API, the
# GitHub release-tag derive + anti-beacon throttle, and the rig-refusal/timeout/stale-terminal
# edges (#597).
# Sourced by tests/stack/run.sh.
#
# Left behind, code-checked (not markers):
# - The "xmrig-proxy entrypoint: unset password appends no flag" assertion sitting inside
#   "rotate-secrets failure path" (#378) is a side-effect check of THAT test group, not this
#   domain — it stays with it, and that group now lives in test-secrets.sh.
# - The per-worker token-mask pair ("per-worker token mask + host-side restore", legacy
#   workers.list[], #172/#679/#506 — the 1.x alias is gone) was a NAMED leave-behind here,
#   deferred to a future $C-sandbox-cluster pass. It has since moved to test-worker-config.sh,
#   and the control-core cluster it was waiting on was cut into test-control-core.sh by #1105
#   R12 — so this bullet survives only for the episode below, and for the RETRACTION of it.
#   RETRACTED (#1105 R12): the mechanism this bullet gave for that episode does NOT reproduce
#   at the tip. It claimed `./pithead apply -y` on a fresh sandbox writes into
#   $C/data/control/results/, so a re-derived $C leaked extra result files into the directory a
#   later malformed-id assertion counts. Four independent re-derivations agree it cannot: every
#   control_write_result call sits on the run-pending/upgrade/verb/backup paths and none on
#   apply; the only apply-path write into results/ is os_state_write inside
#   prepare_control_dirs, gated behind is_appliance(); is_appliance() needs PITHEAD_APPLIANCE=1
#   or both /etc/rauc/system.conf and /usr/local/sbin/pithead-install, which no sandbox run has;
#   and lib.sh control_config() writes only $C/config.json. THE RED WAS REAL — the attempt did
#   take the suite to 2901/1 — but it was never committed, so no tree can settle WHY, and no
#   replacement mechanism is guessed here in place of the refuted one. The RULE it was cited for
#   — a pure consumer of the control sandbox must not build a second one — rests on its own
#   evidence, argued in test-control-core.sh and in the consumer domains own headers.
#
# Re-derivations:
# - $V / $WALLET: lib.sh's build_val_sandbox() sets both; the "config validation" black-box calls
#   it once, ahead of the stratum/xmrig/miner-announce sections below that read them — that
#   section lives in test-config.sh, sourced ahead of this file (a generic multi-field validator,
#   not rig-specific). build_val_sandbox() is idempotent (a fixed $SANDBOX/val path, mkdir -p,
#   template copies), so calling it again here is a safe no-op re-affirm as currently sourced.
# - $DOCKER_LOG: the "apply preserves secrets + propagates" black-box sets it ($V/docker.log); it lives
#   in test-secrets.sh, sourced ahead of this file (a generic multi-key regression, not rig-specific).
# - The worker-config/worker-upgrade verbs below need no control-sandbox re-derivation at all:
#   each case builds its own throwaway dir under $SANDBOX and points PITHEAD_CONFIG_FILE at it,
#   never touching $C — proven by exactly this after-proof once the token-mask pair above was
#   pulled back out.
