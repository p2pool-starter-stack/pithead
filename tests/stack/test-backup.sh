# Backup domain (#1105 Phase 1, appliance lane): the archive/restore round-trip and the
# reset-dashboard verb, backup retry (#970), and required-item preflight
# before anything is touched and diagnoses a tar failure by its real cwd/item state (#1244), an
# absolute PITHEAD_CONFIG_FILE override archived at its real path rather than a doubled
# $PWD-prefixed one (#1244), the plaintext backup/restore round-trip including the archive-layout
# and stay-inside-the-sandbox checks (#140), the encrypted round-trip end to end — unattended
# refusal without a passphrase, --no-encrypt opt-out, env-var/prompt passphrases, wrong-passphrase
# and tamper/truncation refusals before extraction, and a failed encrypted backup leaving nothing
# behind (#374/#549), a failed plaintext backup restarting a stack that was running and removing
# the partial archive (#551), and reset-dashboard targeting the LIVE .env data dirs rather than a
# possibly-unapplied config.json, refusing to guess without them, and its final compose_up_checked
# call being if!-guarded like every other call site so a real compose failure surfaces the #180
# subnet-collision explanation instead of tripping the raw ERR trap (#139/#557/#180).
# Sourced by tests/stack/run.sh.
# This file merges clusters that sat apart in run.sh; the stack_backup
# unit tests used to run first, and the backup/restore + reset-dashboard black-box tests used to run
# later cluster moved earlier safely because every
# fixture below builds its own throwaway dir under $SANDBOX ($RB/$CJ/$BK/$FB/$R/$RD557) — nothing
# here reads or writes $V, $C, or any state a section between the two original positions left behind,
# and nothing between those two original positions reads anything this file's fixtures produce.
#
# Re-derivations (the sandbox-builder WALLET trap — see #1305, still open on this lane):
# - $WALLET: set by lib.sh's build_val_sandbox() (as the checksum-valid $VALID_PRIMARY constant), which
#   the "config validation" black-box calls once, ahead of every section below that reads it as a
#   config.json field value. That section lives in test-config.sh, sourced ahead of this file (a
#   generic multi-field validator, not a backup concern), and this file never needs $V itself (each
#   fixture above builds its own sandbox instead of reusing the shared one) — so re-deriving the bare
#   string is enough; calling the heavier build_val_sandbox() would build a $V this file never touches.
# - $VALID_TARI is a plain lib.sh top-level constant (not
#   build_val_sandbox()-scoped), so it needs no re-derivation here or anywhere else.
WALLET="$VALID_PRIMARY" # checksum-valid mainnet primary (the XMRig donation address) — see #1305
