# Dashboard domain (#1105 Phase 1, appliance lane): the dashboard's own login (Caddy basic_auth
# enable/disable/change previews plus the actual basic_auth block in the rendered Caddyfile, #8),
# generate_caddyfile's scheme/port/Host-header render (secure vs. plain HTTP; a custom HOST_PORT
# moving the vhost off 80/443; the :80 redirect's and :443's own catch-alls so an unmatched Host
# never falls through to Caddy's silent empty-200 default, #1123/#1132/#740), the v2 global-address
# guard that keeps a globally-routable address off both the site list AND the `bind` line — Caddy
# runs a single wildcard listener that matches on Host content alone, so filtering the site list is
# not sufficient — and dashboard_sync_progress's one-curl re-render of /api/state behind `pithead
# status` (#384).
#
# The dashboard-onion cluster (vhost render, client-auth crypto, rotate/upgrade/apply capture
# flows, status) is its own domain in test-dashboard-onion.sh, conventionally sourced after this
# one in run.sh. It used to read two globals this file sets ($auth_hb64, $caddy_https) as a
# cross-file source-order dependency; #1330 re-derives both locally there instead, so this file's
# source position no longer matters to it.
# Sourced by tests/stack/run.sh.
#
# Re-derivations:
# - $V / $WALLET: lib.sh's build_val_sandbox() sets both; the "config validation" black-box calls
#   it once, but that section lives in test-config.sh, sourced AFTER this file — so nothing has
#   built $V by the time the dashboard-auth-lifecycle black-box below runs (docker-compose.yml
#   copy, .env/config.json writes via `seed_env`, $V/bin stubs), so this file needs its own copy.
#   build_val_sandbox() is idempotent (a fixed $SANDBOX/val path, mkdir -p, template copies), so
#   calling it again here is a safe no-op re-affirm, the same re-derivation test-lifecycle.sh uses.
# - Everything else below sources the real $STACK fresh per subshell against a throwaway dir under
#   $SANDBOX and needs no re-derivation: none of it reads or writes the shared $C control sandbox
#   ($REQS/$RESULTS/$STAGED/$AUDIT/$MASKED) — that is not built until the "dashboard control
#   channel" section in test-control-core.sh, sourced after this file and test-dashboard-onion.sh.
