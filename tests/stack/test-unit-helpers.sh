# Unit-helper domain (#1105 Phase 1, appliance lane): the cluster of small helper tests that sat
# at the head of run.sh. Four of them drive a pithead function through run_sourced and assert its
# return code or its stdout — docker_boot_enabled (a systemctl stub on PATH decides which unit
# reports enabled, and docker.service or docker.socket each count on their own), config_bool (a
# config value written explicitly false must stay false rather than be coerced by jq's // default,
# the #294 regression that silently re-enabled the firewall opt-out), env_get_file and
# env_changed_keys (a value containing an "=" survives intact, and only the keys that differ are
# reported), and export_build_provenance (the VERSION file is read and whitespace-trimmed, and an
# absent VERSION yields an empty version rather than an error). The fifth block is a drift guard
# rather than a unit test: it pins the XvB tier thresholds in the dashboard's config.py against the
# human forms written in docs/architecture.md, so the user-facing table cannot fall out of sync
# with TIER_DEFAULTS unnoticed.
# Sourced by tests/stack/run.sh.
#
# NAMED FOR WHAT IT HOLDS. The cut map filed this range under "config-helpers"; of the five blocks
# only config_bool is a config helper, the XvB block is not a helper test at all, and
# tests/stack/test-config.sh already exists — a near-identical neighbour name would send a reader
# to the wrong file.
#
# THIS CUT REORDERS, and saying so is the point. The range is NOT contiguous: domain source
# stanzas are interleaved between these blocks, and every one of them is EXCLUDED from the cut
# rather than nested. (Nesting a stanza would leave the outer domain_ran guard reading the value
# the nested stanza set, so the extracted content would carry zero zero-assertion coverage — not
# narrowed coverage, zero.) Excluding them leaves three pieces, so one vacated position takes the
# source stanza and the others close up. The anchor is the last piece's position, chosen because it
# leaves the most sections standing: the XvB, env-helper and provenance blocks execute exactly
# where they always did, and only the docker_boot_enabled and config_bool blocks move later. They
# do not cross the same set. docker_boot_enabled now runs after test-control-upgrade.sh,
# test-release-signing.sh, test-dashboard.sh, test-dashboard-onion.sh and test-release.sh;
# config_bool after the last three of those. Every other domain file keeps its position.
#
# WHY THAT REORDER IS SAFE, argued in both directions.
#   Outward: the names these blocks assign — $BOOT, $tier_cfg, $tier_doc, $changed, $PROV, $NOVER,
#   $ver and the drift loop's own $tier, $t_name, $t_rest, $t_val and $t_human — are read nowhere
#   else, in run.sh or anywhere else under tests/stack. Swept per name over every tests/stack/*.sh
#   with comments stripped first, because a comment naming a variable is not a read and this lane
#   has been bitten by that three times; the surviving hits were then read individually rather than
#   counted. The
#   one shared name is $CB: this file's config_bool block and tests/stack/test-monero-tari.sh both
#   work in $SANDBOX/cb. That file assigns $CB, mkdir -p's it and writes its own config.json, so it
#   inherits nothing from here — and its stanza is sourced after this file's stanza both before and
#   after the cut.
#   Inward: these blocks read only $SANDBOX, $ROOT and $STACK, each assigned at COLUMN 1 at top
#   level in lib.sh, outside every function body — so none of them is the ordering dependency the
#   $WALLET case turned out to be. (Re-derive by grepping lib.sh for the assignment and reading the
#   indent, not by line number: a citation into another file is the perishable part of any claim
#   here.) The domain files the two moved blocks now run after reassign none of those three and
#   create no systemctl stub that could shadow this file's own; every PATH replacement and every cd
#   in them is confined to a subshell or to a function whose whole body is a subshell. Every path
#   this file writes or reads is anchored on $SANDBOX, $ROOT or $STACK, or is reached by an
#   explicit cd inside a command substitution, so a leaked working directory could not reach them
#   either.
#   The provider functions called are run_sourced, assert_rc, assert_eq, ok and bad.
