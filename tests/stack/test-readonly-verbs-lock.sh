# The other half of the mutation window (#1734, carried out of #1482). Every mutating verb has a
# test proving it TAKES the window; nothing proved that a read-only verb takes nothing and never
# waits. docs/operations.md states that property to the operator, so it is a documented contract,
# and it holds today only because nobody has written `mutation_lock_acquire` into a read-only
# path. Nothing stops the next one: the acquire is one line and it reads as defensive. A stray
# one fails in the most expensive direction there is — `status`, `doctor` and `logs` are exactly
# what an operator reaches for WHILE a long mutating verb runs, so it turns the diagnostic into a
# wait during the incident it was meant to diagnose, and it would pass every other test here.
#
# Behavioural, not a grep for an absent call: `doctor` and `status` read .env and the compose
# state, so what is asserted is that they COMPLETE under contention, not that a particular line
# is missing from a particular function.
