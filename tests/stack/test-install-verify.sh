# install.sh verification domain (#1105 Phase 1, appliance lane): everything the installer does
# before it will put a bundle on a box. The host gate that hard-fails on a platform the stack
# cannot run on, before any download at all (#77 phase 1), and the download-verification path that
# fails CLOSED — a bad sha, a bad signature, a missing key, an occupied target or a corrupt archive
# each refuse the install rather than degrade to trusting HTTPS alone (#868, #1115).
#
# The two sections are one domain and are kept in one file deliberately: the gate decides whether
# an install may start and the verification decides whether it may finish, and a regression that
# moved a check from one to the other would otherwise straddle two files.
# Sourced by tests/stack/run.sh.
#
# Re-derivations:
# - $REL is SEEDED here, and that is the substantive change in this file. It is read to source
#   release.sh for append_bundle_sha256(), which builds the sha manifest the verified-install case
#   needs. Nothing in this domain assigns it: in run.sh it arrived ambiently, because the release
#   and release-signing domains happen to be sourced earlier and each set it for their own reasons.
#   That is an ordering accident, not a dependency this domain declares — sourcing in place
#   preserves it, so the suite is green either way and byte-identity, header order and pass totals
#   are all blind to it by construction. Seeded with the same value its assigners already use,
#   so the sourced-in-place behaviour is unchanged and the file no longer depends on a neighbour
#   having run.
# - $ROOT and $SANDBOX are lib.sh top-level globals, as are the assertion helpers this domain calls
#   (assert_eq, assert_rc, assert_contains, and ok/bad beneath them). $PATH is the environment's.
# - append_bundle_sha256() is release.sh's, reached only through the $REL source above, inside a
#   subshell so it never leaks into this file's own shell.
# - irun() is defined and unset within the moved block; it does not escape this file.
# - This domain never touches $V, seed_env(), $C or the results dir, and writes no ambient .env or
#   Caddyfile, so it needs no sandbox self-arm and carries neither coupling rule.
