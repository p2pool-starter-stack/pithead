# #1443, the wiring half. test-lifecycle.sh's lock_reinvoke_probe cases prove the MECHANISM — a
# marker mutation_lock_acquire exports survives a real process boundary. They do not prove the
# WIRING at the three places that actually build a re-invoked child: run_chain's
# `bash "$self" "$c"`, control_lifecycle's `"$self" restart` / `"$self" apply -y`, and
# control_backup's `"$self" backup -y`.
#
# lock_reinvoke_probe's own child is sourced and hand-called (`bash -c 'source "$1"; stack_down'`),
# never through main()'s dispatch — and because it is sourced, the _STACK_SOURCED guard means
# PITHEAD_SELF is never assigned in it at all. Each site's pre-existing coverage elsewhere points
# PITHEAD_SELF at a stub that only records its argv, so the re-invoked pithead never runs and the
# lock code inside it never executes — a child that dropped the marker would look identical.
#
# Drive all three for real instead: PITHEAD_SELF points at a COPY of $STACK — a real, executable
# pithead, not a stub — so each site's own re-invocation runs the genuine child through main()'s
# dispatch. The control is the one those mechanism cases use: strip the marker and the SAME real
# re-invocation must block on its own ancestor instead of proceeding.
