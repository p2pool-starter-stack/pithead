#
# Shared test harness for tests/stack/run.sh (#1105 Phase 1, first extraction).
#
# The assertion/reporting primitives, the pass/fail counters, and the common fixtures every
# test group in run.sh builds on. This file is *sourced*, never executed on its own — it has
# no shebang and is not marked executable, matching tests/integration/lib.sh's convention.
#
# Mechanical move only: this is the SAME code that used to sit at the top of run.sh, moved
# here verbatim so run.sh can source it. No behaviour changed.

# Every test-*.sh domain file is a FRAGMENT: run.sh sources it after this file, and it carries no
# assertion primitives of its own. Run one directly and all 60-odd assert_* calls are "command not
# found" while the file still exits 0 — a domain reporting success having executed nothing (#1657).
# So each fragment opens by dereferencing this marker with :?, which is set only on the sourced
# path; bash then refuses the direct run with a message naming run.sh, and exits non-zero.
# ⛔ NEVER export this. A plain assignment is what makes the marker work: a child bash cannot
# inherit it, so `bash tests/stack/test-cli.sh` refuses even from inside a suite run. Exporting it
# would silently disarm all 55 fragments at once; test-harness-tooling.sh's #1657 rows say so.
# The five standalone test_*.sh files are NOT fragments (the Makefile runs each one directly, and
# tests/inventory.sh lists them as UNSOURCED) — they carry no marker check and must not gain one.

# verdicts. Evidence and the full reasoning are in #2041. CI is Linux; this never fires there.

# A domain file that fails to source is skipped SILENTLY and the suite still exits 0 (#1400):
# run.sh runs under `set -uo pipefail` with no `-e`, and its verdict is computed from PASS/FAIL
# alone, so a file that never ran contributes nothing to either counter and nothing goes red.
#
# The guard is a POSITIVE control -- did this file move the assertion counters? -- rather than a
# check of `source`'s exit status. That is deliberate: `source` returns the status of the file's
# LAST command, which answers a different question. It reads 0 for a top-level `return`, the one
# failure mode that leaves no diagnostic anywhere, and would read non-zero for a healthy file
# that merely ended on a cleanup that failed. Counting assertions asks what we actually mean, so
# the status is carried only into the message, never into the verdict.
#
# Limit, stated rather than implied: this proves a domain contributed at least one assertion,
# not that it ran to completion. A file that dies half way through still passes. Covering that
# needs a per-domain expected count, which collides with the nondeterminism in #1325.
#
# `return 0` pins this function's status instead of inheriting whatever `bad` last ran. run.sh
# calls it through `... && domain_ran f "$_d0" "$?" || domain_ran f "$_d0" "$?"`, and only a
# non-zero return here would reach the second branch at all. Nothing double-counts even if one
# did: `bad` moves FAIL, the very counter the guard tests, so a second call finds
# `$((PASS + FAIL))` already past `before` and does nothing. That idempotence is what makes the
# duplicated call safe, and it is exactly what SC2015 cannot see. Measured, because an earlier
# version of this comment claimed the opposite and was wrong: without `return 0` both paths
# already return 0, and with an explicit `return 1` the chain still counts FAIL=1, not 2.

# XMRig donation keys re-tagged with a zero payment id and a recomputed checksum — no public
# project publishes a stable integrated donation address. The checksum-INVALID primary is the KVM
# harness wallet that slipped the shape-only gate and crash-looped a provisioned appliance.
