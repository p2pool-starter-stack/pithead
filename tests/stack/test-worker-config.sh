# Worker-config domain (#1105 Phase 1, appliance lane): per-worker token masking and host-side
# restore, across the two config shapes that carry rig credentials. A per-rig token lives in a
# VARIABLE-LENGTH array, which puts it outside the fixed CONTROL_SECRET_PATHS walk that covers the
# scalar secrets, so each shape needs its own proof that the property still holds — the masked
# prefill copy must sentinel every set token rather than the first one, and the staging swap must
# restore each sentinel from the live token rather than committing the sentinel itself. The legacy
# removed 1.x dashboard.workers[] shape (#172/#679) and the workers.list[] shape (#506) separately
# because they are read by different code paths, not because the property differs.
# Sourced by tests/stack/run.sh.
#
# THIS FILE IS POSITION-LOCKED AND IS NOT SOURCEABLE ON ITS OWN — both deliberately. It inherits
# the control sandbox that the black-box control-channel run builds once and then mutates in a
# chain: $C and $CTRL_LOG come from lib.sh's build_control_sandbox, and $AUDIT, $MASKED, $REQS,
# $RESULTS and $STAGED from sections that #1105 R12 moved out of run.sh into
# test-control-core.sh, sourced earlier. Nothing here builds a sandbox, and nothing here should.
# The sections commit through the real gate, so they write into the shared request spool and
# append to the shared audit log — and two sections that run AFTER this one, both now in
# test-spool-audit.sh, count exactly that: "audit log growth is bounded (#349)" measures the
# audit log's length, and "spool intake cap + symlink refusal + stale sweep (#33 hardening)"
# asserts the request spool holds exactly ten overflow intents and then none. A fresh sandbox
# built here, or this file sourced at any other point in the run's order, moves those counts and
# reds two domains that never changed. Sourcing in place is what keeps them right, so the
# ordering is a contract rather than an accident, and it is stated here because a survived
# accident and an honoured contract look identical from a green suite.
#
# That is the same contract test-control-add-only-ssrf.sh already ships under: split out for the
# file-budget ratchet, inheriting the fixtures of the section it came from.
#
# Every other name the block reads it also assigns — the request UUIDs it drives the gate with are
# its own. From lib.sh it calls assert_eq, run_pending and run_sourced, and also ok and bad
# directly, inside the case blocks that check no secret leaked.
echo "== black-box: per-worker token mask + host-side restore, legacy dashboard.workers (#172/#679) =="
# dashboard.workers[].token is a per-rig credential living in a VARIABLE-LENGTH array — out of the
# fixed CONTROL_SECRET_PATHS walk. The masked prefill copy must sentinel each set token (extends
# the #440 property per-rig), and the staging swap must restore each sentinel from the LIVE token
# matched by worker NAME. Per-worker descriptors are never dashboard-EDITABLE (the commit gate
# refuses any dashboard.workers change, asserted above) — so this restore is exactly what lets an
# operator's OTHER edits round-trip: the workers come back as sentinels and must resolve to the
# live values unchanged, or every dashboard commit on a stack with configured workers would fail.
# 2.0.0 REMOVED the alias (#1832), which does not retire this block — it sharpens it. A live
# config carries dashboard.workers[] between a hand-edit (or a restored 1.x backup) and the next
# host apply, and 49-control-request-loop.sh:81 re-renders the prefill before draining precisely to
# pick up such edits, so this state reaches the masker. The mask therefore STAYS, and the restore
# must stay with it: they are one mechanism, and a mask whose restore cannot resolve blanks every
# per-rig token instead of leaking one. Hand-edit to legacy and render the masked copy, no apply.
