#   tests/integration/e2e.sh claude/my-feature --mode matrix
#
#   4. Borrows a miner (set MINER_HOST): backs up its xmrig config and repoints it at the test bench so
#      the live matrix has a real worker mining through this stack.
#   5. Deploys the branch (`pithead upgrade` — re-renders configs AND rebuilds the branch's first-party
#      images from build/, so a Dockerfile/entrypoint change is actually tested #272) and runs the live
#      harness (tests/integration/run.sh) DETACHED on the box so an SSH drop can't kill a long matrix.
#   6. ALWAYS restores: the miner's original pool config, and the canonical baseline stack — even
#      on failure or Ctrl-C (an EXIT trap). The synced chains are never touched. The restore then
#      PROVES the live stack matches the on-disk config (#971): a credential marker baked into a
#      running container must equal the on-disk .env's line, and monerod must answer a host-side
#      authed get_info with the on-disk creds. A failed proof exits non-zero, loudly.
#
# The Compose project name is pinned to "pithead", so the e2e checkout and the canonical checkout
# drive the SAME containers + the SAME shared chains — they are two code copies of one stack, run
# one at a time, not two stacks. That's why borrow→test→restore is a code/image swap, not a re-sync.
#
# Requires: SSH access to the test bench and the miner (keys, LAN reachable), and `jq` on both.
# See tests/integration/tools/testbench-README.md and docs/dev/integration-testing.md.

Run a branch end-to-end against a live test bench, then restore everything.

USAGE:
  tests/integration/e2e.sh <branch> [options]

OPTIONS:
  --mode <m>        targeted | check | matrix   (default: targeted)
                      targeted — one canonical scenario, lifecycle, auth and RigForge.
                      check — readiness/current-state reads. matrix — all destructive phases.
  --scenario <name> with --mode matrix, run only this existing scenario plus the matrix-only phases
  --workers <n>     workers expected mining through the stack (default: 1 — the borrowed miner)
  --bench <host>    SSH host of the test bench to deploy onto (or set BENCH_HOST)
  --miner <host>    SSH host of the miner to borrow (or set MINER_HOST)
  --no-miner        do not borrow a miner; skip its two mining assertions
  --skip-preflight  skip the bench-chains-synced pre-flight
  --keep            don't restore at the end (leave the branch deployed + miner repointed — debugging)
  -h, --help        this help

ENV OVERRIDES: BENCH_HOST, MINER_HOST, CANONICAL_DIR, E2E_DIR, MINER_XMRIG_CONFIG, GIT_REMOTE_URL, and
  RIG_HOST, RIG_NAME, IT_RIG_TOKEN, IT_RIG_ROLLBACK_CHANGES, IT_RIG_POOLS_PROBE, RIG_CONTROL_PORT, RIGFORGE_CONFIG, RIGFORGE_BOOTSTRAP_VERSION

EXAMPLES:

  tests/integration/e2e.sh claude/my-feature --mode check    # safe, non-destructive first run
