#
# The p2pool -> Tari merge-mining gRPC round-trip probe (#1397).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Merge-mining is what makes Tari pay, and it is driven entirely by p2pool — a
# third-party binary — not by any client we wrote. `fakes/test_contract.py` looks like it covers
# this and does not: it drives the DASHBOARD's Tari client against `fake_tari.py`. Before this
# file, nothing at any tier observed p2pool reaching the Tari node, so a gRPC method moving
# behind an allow-list (the named risk on the Tari v5.6.0 bump, and the exact shape of #313)
# would land with every gate green.
#
# WHY TIER 4 AND NOT A FAKE. #1397 offered "drive p2pool's merge-mining client against a
# controllable fake" as the cheaper half that would also escape the sync problem. Measured at
# p2pool v4.18's source (the pinned binary we ship): there is exactly ONE creation site for
# merge-mining clients, `IMergeMiningClient::create`, and it sits inside the success callback of
# `download_block_headers4` — after `BLOCK_HEADERS_REQUIRED = 720` headers parse. So a fake would
# have to serve 720 consecutive, self-consistent Monero block headers and a live ZMQ publisher
# before the Tari fake is reached at all. That is not the cheaper half; it re-implements a synced
# monerod. Option 1 — a real box whose chain is already synced — is the one that works, and the
# release gate already runs on one.
#
# WHAT PROVES A ROUND-TRIP, AND WHAT ONLY LOOKS LIKE ONE. p2pool emits three lines. Two are
# LOCAL and prove only that the object was constructed and its threads spun:
#
#     MergeMiningClientTari event loop started
#     MergeMiningClientTari worker thread ready
#
# The third is the only assertion worth building on:
#
#     MergeMiningClientTari tari://<host:port> uses chain_id <id>
#
# because p2pool cannot know the chain_id without a successful call to the Tari node. Measured on
# the live stack, the two local lines land ~175 ms BEFORE the chain_id read, so asserting on
# either would be satisfiable with Tari unreachable — the false green this harness exists to
# kill. That is why `local-only` is its own verdict and a FAILURE, not a near-miss pass. It is
# also the most informative failure here: it says the client is up and Tari is not answering.
#
# THE LOG IS ANSI-COLOURED AND THE ESCAPES SIT MID-LINE. Measured with `cat -v` on the live
# stack, the chain_id line really reads:
#
#     ^[[0;90mMergeMiningClientTari ^[[0mtari://127.0.0.1:18142 uses chain_id ^[[0;96m01f0…
#
# `docker compose logs --no-color` suppresses DOCKER's colouring, not the application's own. A
# pattern written against the rendered text — `MergeMiningClientTari tari://.* uses chain_id` —
# therefore matches NOTHING, silently. That failure is invisible in the worst way: a probe that
# always reports "absent" looks identical to a working one right up to the moment it matters.
# Strip the escapes first, then match. The self-test carries the fired negative control.
#
# THE SIGNAL IS STARTUP-ONLY. The three lines land within ~17.5s of the container's start — at
# positions 68/69/71 of a log that had reached 83,070 lines after 30h (ONE sample, live stack,
# 2026-08-30). `--tail 200` cannot contain them on a container that has been up minutes, so this
# read is bounded by the container's own StartedAt and a head window, never by a tail.

# The startup window, in lines. The observed maximum position is 71 (one sample), so 2000 is
# ~28x headroom while still being two orders below a day-old log — "startup" stays a real bound
# rather than a name. It is a CEILING, not a cost: `head` closes the pipe, and only the matching
# lines ever cross the wire.
MM_WINDOW_LINES=2000

# Strip SGR escape sequences. PURE.
# The ESC byte is written with bash ANSI-C quoting rather than a `\x1b` inside the sed script,
# because that spelling depends on the sed implementation and this box's text tools are shims.

#   local-only            the client was constructed, but no chain_id was ever read
#   absent                p2pool never constructed a merge-mining client at all

# Returns 0 ONLY for roundtrip. PURE — a function of the text alone, so the self-test drives
# every class from a fixture with no stack, no container and no network.

# Capture the CURRENT container run's merge-mining lines. Both bounds are load-bearing:
#
#   --since <StartedAt>  excludes any EARLIER startup epoch. Docker's restart policy can restart
#                        p2pool in place, and the log then still carries the old startup's
#                        chain_id line — which would satisfy this assertion while the live client
#                        never reached Tari. StartedAt moves with the restart; the log does not.
#   head -n <window>     keeps this a startup read rather than a whole-log scan.

# `docker inspect` is used with --format naming ONE field. Unformatted, it prints `.Args`, which
# on this stack carries both wallet addresses, the RPC credential and the onion address; the same

# wire, so none of that is transferred here (#1582/#1585/#1586).

# The release-gate leg: PASS, FAIL, or an honest counted SKIP — never a silent green.
#
# THE CAPTURE IS READ BEFORE THE PREDICATE, AND THAT ORDER IS ITSELF AN ASSERTION (#1597).
# `monero_caught_up` REDUCED several independent conditions to one bit: its `curl -fsS` discards
# stderr and leaves the body EMPTY on an unreachable RPC, a refused connection or a 401, and
# `jq -e` over an empty body answered exactly as it does for a node that is genuinely behind.
# #1605 has since split that bit three ways — 0 caught up, 1 answered-and-behind, any other rc
# could-not-ask — but THIS SITE DELIBERATELY TAKES BOTH NONZERO DOORS: `! monero_caught_up` below
# is true for each, and the skip's own text says "could not be confirmed caught up", which is a
# true statement about both. The capture-first order, not the predicate's precision, is what keeps
# this skip honest; narrowing the test to `= 1` here would make the leg red on an unreachable RPC
# in the one case p2pool has already proved the signal cannot exist.
# Asked first, that one bit decided the whole leg — so a stack whose monerod was synced and whose
# merge-mining client was up and reading chain_ids would have been booked as an ACCEPTED HOLE for
# as long as the RPC stayed unanswerable. That state is not hypothetical here — `lib.sh`'s
# env_bake_verdict comment records a day of it; read the incident there, not a second copy of it.
# The capture answers the question the predicate was standing in for, and answers it from p2pool
# rather than from the RPC we could not reach: p2pool constructs a MergeMiningClientTari only
# after its block-header download succeeds, so ANY such line is proof that monerod caught up.
#
# The skip stays classed `by-design` rather than `missing` on the skip-accounting test, and
# reading the capture first is what makes that class honest rather than merely conventional. It
# is now reached only when the startup window WAS read and held no merge-mining line at all — so
# p2pool built no client, so the header download did not complete, so no input, flag or env var
# to THIS harness would make the signal exist (cycle 40 measured zero Tari gRPC calls across five
# legs against absent, synced-fake and partial-fake monerods). Covering it means running against
# a synced chain, not supplying something.
#
# Every case the reorder moves, it moves OUT of the skip ledger into a pass or a fail; no case
# that previously passed or failed can become a skip. That direction is the safety argument, and
# the self-test asserts all three moved cases rather than resting on it.
