# Sourced by e2e.sh, which supplies on_bench/ok/warn/step, RESTORE_DIR, E2E_DIR and
# env_bake_verdict/control_units_verdict (lib.sh). Split out of e2e.sh rather than written there:
# the classifier below has to be drivable with no ssh and no docker, because that is the tier its
# mutation proof runs at (selftest-e2e-restore-proof.sh), and e2e.sh is at its file budget.
#
# The proof answers one question the rest of the harness cannot: after the EXIT trap has put the
# box back, is the box actually back? A restore that half-worked looks exactly as healthy as one
# that worked — that is the #971 incident, and the image check below is the same shape one layer
# further in.

# What the live stack was RUNNING, by service, before this run touched anything, and what
# deploy_branch then built. Both are image IDs, not tags: the defect they exist to catch is a tag
# that MOVED, so the tag cannot be the instrument. Empty means "not captured" — a skip, never a pass.

# The image OBJECT each running service is on. `docker ps` scopes it to the one pinned Compose

# Which services came back on what. Pure — three strings in, one verdict per baseline service out,
# no ssh and no docker — so the mutation proof for it runs with no bench
# (selftest-e2e-restore-proof.sh). Graded per service because a partial overlap is the realistic
# case: a branch that changes two Dockerfiles rebuilds two images, and the other services
# legitimately carry an image ID that matches the baseline AND the branch.
#   kept     the same image object it ran before the run
#   rebuilt  different from both censuses — built from RESTORE_DIR's own tree by the restore
#   stale    the image THIS RUN built for the branch, now running under the baseline's name
#   gone     ran before the run, not running now
# `stale` is graded before `rebuilt` on purpose: an image that equals the branch's is never
# evidence of a rebuild, however different it is from the baseline.
# No `[ -n "$branch" ]` guard on the stale arm, deliberately: reaching it already requires a
# non-empty $now, so an absent branch census (a --mode check run, where deploy_branch never ran)
# fails the equality on its own. The guard was there in the first draft; it could not change any
# outcome, and the mutation battery is what showed that — an unkillable mutant is a claim about the
# code, not about the test.
# It walks the BASELINE, so a service that only exists in the after-census is not graded: the
# question here is whether what was running came back, not whether something new appeared. A new
# service is a compose-file change, which the deploy phase already exercises.

# Restore proof (#971): after the restore brings the baseline back up, prove the LIVE stack
# actually runs RESTORE_DIR's on-disk config. A pre-#921 e2e run once left the containers on
# harness-rendered creds while the on-disk .env kept the real ones — internally consistent, so it
# mined and looked healthy for a day, while every host-side RPC probe 401ed. Four checks:
#   1. The credential marker baked into the running dashboard container (docker inspect) is the
#      same line as the on-disk .env's — env_bake_verdict (lib.sh) prints verdict words only,
#      never values.
#   2. monerod answers a host-side get_info with the on-disk creds — the exact probe the incident
#      broke. Only .status is required (sync may still be re-confirming); polled briefly because
#      the containers were just recreated. The probe script travels over ssh stdin (bash -s), so
#      the creds stay on the box and the remote command string carries no shell parens.
#   3. The box-global control units still name RESTORE_DIR (#1085). deploy_branch's `pithead
#      upgrade` repoints them at E2E_DIR, and the hardening phase's teardown deletes them outright
#      when it owns them — either way the live dashboard's config edits and one-click upgrades
#      queue into a spool nothing watches, while every other signal here still reads healthy.
#      The verdict comes from RESTORE_DIR's OWN doctor, run from RESTORE_DIR. That is not a
#      preference: check_control_units compares the installed units' ExecStart against $PWD, and
#      `pithead` cd's to the directory of the binary you invoke (SCRIPT_DIR, pithead:100) — so the
#      BRANCH's copy would compare against E2E_DIR and print the OK verdict on exactly the
#      stranded box this check exists to catch. It needs RESTORE_DIR on v1.19.2+, the release that
#      added the check; anything older classifies as no-check and FAILS rather than passing quietly.
#   4. The live containers are on the images the baseline ran, or on ones rebuilt from RESTORE_DIR
#      — never on the ones this run built for the branch. Spelled out at the check itself.
# Returns 0 when all four hold.

    # 4. WHAT CODE IS ACTUALLY RUNNING. Checks 1-3 are all green on a stack running the BRANCH's

    #    way. Not one of them ever looked at the image. The restore comment at #454 already warned
    #    that restoring from the wrong dir "hands the pithead project locally-built :dev images" —
    #    this is the same hazard reached from the RIGHT dir, when that dir is a source checkout and
    #    therefore shares `:dev` with the branch under test.
    #    Graded per service against two censuses, because a partial overlap is the realistic case —
    #    a branch that only changes two Dockerfiles rebuilds only two images, and the other three
    #    legitimately match both sides:
    #      same as baseline          -> restored (or never rebuilt). Fine.
    #      differs, EQUALS the branch-> the branch's image is live under the baseline's name. RED.
    #      differs from both         -> rebuilt from RESTORE_DIR's own tree. Reported, not asserted:
    #                                   "not the branch's" is a weaker claim than "built from
