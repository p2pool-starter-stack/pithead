# Settle a dashboard-mediated RigForge worker-apply intent past its dial-time "accepted" (#1309).
#
# RigForge #344: the rig now answers "accepted" immediately and applies async. pithead's own host
# runner (control_worker_apply in the `pithead` CLI) caps its post-dial /status poll at 20s and,
# past that, writes an "accepted … outcome not yet observed" result verbatim — its own words: "the
# container can keep polling the rig via the next read." That next read is the dashboard's regular
# per-rig poll (data_service.py's run loop), which on the SAME poll tick both:
#   (a) refreshes the enriched feed's live watchdog value (served at /api/state, read by
#       _pred_feed_maxt in run.sh), and
#   (b) reconciles a still-"accepted" #185 worker-config history row to its real terminal status
#       (worker_config_store.py:reconcile_worker_config_status, #579/#604) — step 3a in that poll,
#       strictly BEFORE the enriched-feed merge at step 3b.
# So observing the feed converge to the requested max_temp_c is proof the requested key (the only
# key in a max_temp_c change) is what changed — no direct rig dial needed (IT_RIG_TOKEN/RIG_HOST
# bench flags aren't always set: the live-box case uses the baseline's own workers.list[]
# descriptor without them), and no reliance on the dial-time result ever changing.
#
# ⛔ WHAT IT DOES NOT PROVE, AND THIS MODULE USED TO CLAIM IT DID (#1471): that the #185 history
# row for that change_id is terminal by the time a caller reads it back. The (a)/(b) ordering
# above is real — 3a does run before 3b, and both surfaces come off one poll — but both are
# downstream of a rig file written BEFORE the rig has decided the outcome at all. RigForge commits
# the new config at the START of a control-apply (_control_commit's `mv -f`) and writes the
# terminal status.json only at the END, after the apply, an xmrig restart and a `_wait_miner_live`
# bounded at 20 tries x 3s; the reconciler cannot move the row off "accepted" until it has read
# that second file, which costs up to one further UPDATE_INTERVAL. A settle on the readback
# surface therefore ends at the START of that gap, not after it. The claim survived because two of
# the three keys that reach the row, max_temp_c and watchdog_interval_min, are on RigForge's
# restart-free fast path (CONTROL_FAST_PATH_KEYS, rigforge.sh:4203 at v1.16.0), where the gap is
# too small to see. The third, DONATION, is off that list and takes the full path — which is where
# the 90s bound below comes from, and where a hardware run would have hit this.
# Callers asserting on the row go through _settle_history_row below, which waits for it.
# Fails loudly (leaves status/ckeys at their dial-time "accepted"/empty) on a real
# rejected/failed/timeout, exactly like a "the change never actually happened" bug would.
#
# Sourced by run.sh, which supplies wait_for (lib.sh) and the readback predicates. Fields are
# '|'-joined, not tab — `read` with IFS=tab (an IFS-whitespace character) SQUASHES an empty
# middle field instead of preserving it, misaligning every field after it; '|' can't appear in
# any of the three values, so it splits correctly even when ckeys/change_id come back empty.

# The settle itself, generic over WHAT is watched. The wrapper is identical for every writable key
# — parse the dial result, and if it is the non-terminal "accepted", wait for the rig to actually
# report the change before calling it applied. Only the readback surface differs, so that arrives as
# a predicate: max_temp_c has live telemetry in the enriched feed's watchdog stats (the only
# writable key that does), while the keys added by #1236 read the rig's own reported config. Both
# ride the same per-rig poll tick, so the readback half of the reasoning above holds either way —
# and neither of them says anything about the history row, which is why that has its own settle.

# Terminal is stated as the COMPLEMENT of the non-terminal pair, not as an allowlist of #1009's
# six names, and the direction matters: a status this harness has never seen must read as terminal
# and let the caller's assert_eq name it. An allowlist would turn a newly added rig status into a
# 90s timeout reported as "the row never settled" — the wrong diagnosis, and one that costs the
# full bound to reach. Empty is non-terminal because there is no row yet, not because it is stuck.

# Wait that row to terminal, then report it (#1471). Waiting for TERMINAL rather than for
# "applied" is what keeps the caller's assertion honest in both directions: a rig that genuinely
# rejected or failed the change publishes a terminal row at once, so this returns that status and
# the caller reds immediately instead of burning the bound on a verdict already known; a row that
# never settles stays "accepted" and reds too. The one answer it must never invent is "applied"
# for a row nobody has confirmed — which is what reading the row unwaited did, across a window of
# up to ~90s (_wait_miner_live + one UPDATE_INTERVAL), and why the bound here is that same 90s.
#
# The `>&2` is this module's #1454 discipline, for the same reason: stdout is the return value and
# wait_for opens with an it_step banner on stdout. The wait's rc is deliberately NOT guarded: the
# read below runs either way (run.sh:20 — "NOT -e: we deliberately continue-on-error"), and on a
# timeout reporting the status the row is STUCK at is what lets the caller's assert_eq name it.
