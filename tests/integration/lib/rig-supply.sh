# rig-supply.sh — resolve what the dashboard-to-rig WRITE phase needs, and PROVE it before saying so.
#
# Sourced by e2e.sh. run.sh's --rigforge-control phase reads two inputs that e2e.sh never supplied,
# and neither string appeared anywhere in that file (#1378). Unsupplied, the phase does not fail — it
# drops legs quietly, which is the shape this harness exists to stop:
#
#   * The whole phase self-skips unless the bench's baseline config already happens to pin a
#     workers.list[] descriptor for the rig (run.sh:2135-2139), taking #513/#514/#516/#517/#1002b/
#     #1236 with it. Whether that fires depends on bench state the harness does not control.
#   * #516's enriched-feed reflection leg — the one that dials the rig directly to prove the
#     rig-to-dashboard direction — can NEVER run (run.sh:2294-2296). The prefill half still prints,
#     so the section reads as covered.
#   * #517 loses the rig-poll settle fallback (run.sh:2373), so a CORRECT auto-rollback on a slow rig
#     asserts red. That makes the gap a flake source as well as a coverage hole.
#
# Both inputs default from what a borrow already holds, so the MANDATED pre-cut run (--mode targeted,
# docs/dev/releasing.md) is supplied without the operator handling a secret by hand. A fix that needed
# an env var set by hand would leave the mandated run self-skipping exactly as before.
#
#   RIG_HOST      defaults to MINER_HOST. On this bench that is a LAN name the bench resolves itself,
#                 not an ssh-config alias private to the driving machine. Passing the NAME rather than
#                 a resolved address also keeps a literal address out of argv and the log, and avoids
#                 the bracket quoting a raw IPv6 literal would need in the URL.
#   IT_RIG_TOKEN  read over the SSH the borrow already holds. /opt/rigforge/config.json is mode 600
#                 owned by the SSH user UNTIL the rig takes its first control-apply — RigForge's
#                 control service runs as root and rewrites that file, and it is root-owned from
#                 then on (#1466). This comment used to say "so no sudo is involved", which was true
#                 of a rig that had never been written to and false forever after on one that had.
#                 So: unprivileged read first, `sudo -n` only as the fallback when that read FAILED,
#                 and the read's own error is no longer swallowed. The swallowing is what made this
#                 expensive — a permission-denied read and a file with no token in it both arrived
#                 as an empty string, run.sh dropped the whole write phase, and the gate printed
#                 `✓ E2E PASSED`. The two cases now report as two different sentences.
#
# Neither default is TRUSTED. rig_supply dials the rig's control API from the BENCH — the box whose
# legs will dial it — and reports which case it took, because "the harness does not report which case
# it took" is half of what #1378 is about.
#
# The token travels on on_bench's STDIN and reaches the runner as an ENVIRONMENT entry
# (/proc/PID/environ is owner-only). Probes feed curl configuration through stdin too, so neither
# the shell/SSH command nor curl argv carries the token. It never touches the bench's disk or logs.

# BORROWED FROM THE SOURCER, declared rather than left to be discovered: `ok`, `warn`, `on_miner` and
# `on_bench` are defined in e2e.sh (:73/:74/:171/:172), which sources this file at :38 — BEFORE any of
# them exists. That is correct only because rig_supply is called from run_harness, long after. Sourcing
# this file alone and calling rig_supply gets `warn: command not found` and rc 0 — it reports nothing,
# because the warnings ARE the report. `quote_arg` is the one helper that comes from lib.sh.
