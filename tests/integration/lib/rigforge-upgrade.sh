#
# The RigForge one-click upgrade legs (#1002a noop, #1237 real upgrade).
#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, AND WHAT WAS WRONG BEFORE (#1237)
#
# The old leg lived in run.sh and read, in full: take the rig's OWN reported version out of
# /api/state, POST it back to /api/control/worker-upgrade, assert the terminal status is "noop".
# It was documented as exercising "the real dashboard -> host-runner -> rig /upgrade route end to
# end". It cannot. It is a tautology, and the chain is short enough to state completely:
#
#   1. /api/state is build_state(app["latest_data"], ...) and build_workers copies the rig's
#      version through verbatim (xmrig_client.parse_rigforge -> infra_views._rigforge_display).
#   2. handle_worker_upgrade reads `running` from that SAME app["latest_data"] — the poll loop
#      mutates that dict in place (data_service `self.latest_data.update({...})`), it never
#      rebinds it — and short-circuits to a synchronous {"status":"noop"} when
#      parse_semver(running) == parse_semver(version).
#   3. The harness sets version FROM running. So the comparison is true by construction.
#
# The request therefore returned noop without ever reaching control_service.submit_worker_upgrade,
# the host runner, or the rig. The single assertion could only fail if the rig's reported version
# changed between the two reads — which requires a real upgrade, the one thing not under test.
# Combined with the flag (--rigforge-upgrade) that no caller sets, the gate's only upgrade
# coverage was an opt-in check that could not go red. That is this lane's subject in miniature.
#
# WHAT REPLACES IT: the precondition split
#
# The old leg had an unstated precondition — "the rig is already on latest" — and asserted a
# result that holds whether or not it is true. Make the precondition the SELECTOR instead and both
# branches become falsifiable, because each one asserts WHICH path the request took:
#
#   rig behind latest  -> the REAL upgrade. POST latest. The shortcut cannot fire (running !=
#                         version), so a 202 {"id", "status":"pending"} is itself the proof that
#                         the request left the dashboard process. Then poll to terminal, require
#                         `applied`, and require the rig to come back reporting latest AND hashing.
#                         Having put the rig on latest and verified it, run the noop leg after it:
#                         its precondition is now something we established rather than assumed.
#   otherwise          -> skip, loudly and classified. `.rigforge_update` is null for THREE
#                         different states (on latest / ahead of latest / no release cached,
#                         compute_update returns None for all of them) and nothing else in
#                         /api/state distinguishes them — `rigforge_release` is consumed by
#                         build_workers and never re-exposed. So the honest answer is "cannot
#                         tell", and the skip reason names both branches rather than picking one.
#
# On a rig already on latest this reports a classified skip where the old leg reported a pass.
# That is the point: a skip that announces itself is worth more than a green that proves nothing
# (#1083/#1444's whole argument, applied to this lane's own instrument).
#
# NOT COVERED, and it is a real limit rather than an oversight: this leg cannot exercise the
# rig's REBUILD path. rigforge#413 — XMRIG_VERSION/XMRIG_COMMIT are byte-identical at all 25
# published tags, so `rigforge.sh upgrade` takes its early return on every published release pair
# and the one-click path checks out the new tree without recompiling, regenerating config or
# reinstalling units. No pair of published tags exercises the rebuild, so no choice of tags here
# would cover it; saying so is the honest report, not a gap this file can close.
#
# Sourced by run.sh, which supplies api_state/rx/quote_arg (lib.sh), the assert_* helpers,
# it_skip_leg (skip-accounting.sh) and wait_for. Every function here is drivable standalone
# against stubs — that is the tier the mutation proofs live at (selftest-rigforge-upgrade.sh),
# not a bench.

# How long to wait for the rig to come back reporting the new version after a terminal upgrade.
# The host's own poll cap is 90s (CONTROL_WU_POLL_CAP) and it hands back "accepted" rather than a
# failure when the rig is still working, so the harness has to be able to outlast it: the rig's
# version reaches the dashboard on the per-rig summary poll, not on the upgrade result.
