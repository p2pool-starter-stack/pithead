#
# The Worker Inspect writable-key apply legs (#1236), and the reasoned refusals that go with them.
#
# The control phase used to prove the write path on ONE key. `max_temp_c` (#513) had a live readback
# in the enriched feed, so its round trip could be asserted; `pools` (#1002b) did not, so it was
# built on the dashboard's own `last_applied` record and gated behind an `IT_RIG_POOLS_PROBE` the
# harness sets nowhere. The other four writable keys had no leg at all. A gate that applies one of
# six keys is not a gate on "the writable path works" — it is a gate on max_temp_c.
#
# What changed: RigForge v1.10.0 (rigforge#253) serves the rig's own EFFECTIVE writable config on
# the enriched feed, and the dashboard re-exposes it at `GET /api/worker?name=<rig>` as
# `.rig_config` (#1235, views.py). So the harness can now read the original from the rig itself,
# derive a probe from it, and assert the rig's OWN reported value changed and was restored — no new
# env var, no direct rig dial, no new port, and no reliance on a record of what we last pushed.
#
# The settle reasoning is rigforge-apply-settle.sh's: `.rig_config` rides the same per-rig poll
# tick as the enriched feed (data_service step 3b), which runs strictly AFTER the #185 history
# reconcile (step 3a). That ordering is real, but it does NOT make the row terminal by the time
# the readback lands — the rig publishes its config before it has decided the outcome, so the
# settle ends at the start of that gap (#1471, derived in full on that module). The history
# assertion below therefore waits for the row itself, through _settle_history_row.
#
# Sourced by run.sh, which supplies wait_for (lib.sh), the assert_* helpers, rx/quote_arg, and
# _worker_apply. Every function here is drivable standalone against stubs — that is the tier the
# mutation proofs live at (selftest-rigforge-writable-keys.sh), not a bench.

# The Worker Inspect detail for a rig — `.rig_config`, `.history`, `.last_applied`, all of it.
_worker_detail() { # <rig> -> the /api/worker detail JSON

# Read one writable key out of the rig's own reported config, as compact JSON. Empty when the rig
# sent no usable config at all (`.rig_config` null — "could not read", NOT "empty"; views.py says so
# explicitly) or when this rig's RigForge predates rigforge#253 and never sends that key.
#
# `has()` rather than the shorter `// empty`, and the reason is narrower than it looks: jq treats
# only `false` and `null` as falsy, so the two forms agree on every value these six keys take today
# — a measured DONATION of 0 survives `//` intact. This is a guard against the shape, not a fix for
# a live bug. It earns its place because the allowlist is not closed: the first boolean writable key
# added upstream would make `// empty` read a legitimate `false` as "the rig never sent this", and
# that leg would then skip itself in silence — which is the exact failure this issue is about.
# (Spelled out because an earlier draft of this comment claimed `//` swallowed a 0. It does not; the
# self-test's mutation run is what caught the claim, and the control now covers the `false` case.)

# #1236, and the refusals. Three of the six writable keys are deliberately NOT driven here, and the

#   max_temp_c            already round-tripped by the #513 leg. A duplicate proves nothing.
#   autotune              disabled -> enabled starts a REAL tuning run: it moves hashrate and
#                         thermals and may not settle inside the leg's window. Not on a loan rig.
#   watchdog              enabled -> disabled removes thermal protection from a rig mining at
#                         max_temp_c=100. Brief is still real on hardware we do not own.
#   pools                 REFUSED as a self-derived round trip, and this one is a finding, not a
#                         preference: `.rig_config.pools` is LOSSY and the loss is undetectable.
#                         RigForge's own feed deletes `pass` and `tls-fingerprint` before serving
#                         (rigforge.sh _api_config_json), and the dashboard's _strip_credentials
#                         deletes them again at any depth. `pass` is load-bearing — it is the
#                         Pithead stratum password (#113), and a rig whose `pass` no longer matches
#                         is REJECTED by the proxy at login. So writing a self-read pools value back
#                         would silently strip the credential and strand a borrowed production
#                         miner, and the harness cannot even tell "this rig has no pass" from "this
#                         rig's pass was stripped on the way to me" — both read as `{"url": …}`.
