# Drive the integration mini-stack (issue #54, tier 3) through the control-plane state machine
# and assert the REAL dashboard holds/releases and rejects/readmits the REAL miner containers,
# driven by the controllable fakes. Needs docker (compose v2). Runs in CI; also `make
# test-mini-stack`.
#
# Scenarios:
#    1. boot syncing              → dashboard HOLDS itest-p2pool + itest-xmrig-proxy (#35)
#    2. monerod synced, Tari not  → still HELD (the gate needs both required chains)
#    3. both chains synced        → dashboard RELEASES them
#    +. healthchecks (#79)        → REAL loop fires a liveness heartbeat to the fake-hc receiver
#                                   (pure dead-man's switch; node-health alerting is Telegram #121)
#    4. Tari down (required)      → dashboard REJECTS workers (stops itest-xmrig-proxy) (#31)
#    5. Tari back                 → dashboard READMITS workers
#    6. monerod down              → dashboard REJECTS workers (#31/#564)
#    7. monerod back              → dashboard READMITS workers (#564)
#    8. monerod busy/mid-reorg    → dashboard REJECTS, then READMITS on recovery
#    9. monerod + Tari both down  → REJECTS; recovering only one does NOT readmit; both does
#   10. dashboard restart         → the one-way sync latch survives (#35 persistence)
#   11. Tari OPTIONAL, Tari down  → dashboard keeps mining, workers stay accepted (#562)
