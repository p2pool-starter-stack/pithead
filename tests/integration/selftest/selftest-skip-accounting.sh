# Self-test for the harness's skip accounting (#1365).
#
# The defect this locks down was an ABSENCE. The harness had exactly three counter increments —
# IT_PASS, IT_FAIL, and the scenario skip — so every leg-level and phase-level drop incremented
# nothing and appeared in no column. A run that dropped the entire rigforge-control phase and a
# run that exercised it produced summaries differing only in the pass count, and the pass count
# moves for a dozen unrelated reasons. Nothing in the output could say "this did not run", which
# leaves a reader unable to tell "checked and clean" from "never ran" — the distinction a release
# gate exists to make.
#
# Two halves, and the second is the one that keeps the fix alive:
#   1. the counters and the named list behave (each helper moves its OWN bucket, records what and
#      why), and the REAL summary() out of run.sh renders all three buckets and the names;
#   2. a CENSUS of the shipped harness: no skip may go out through a bare `it_warn` again. That is
#      the regression the fix was for — 34 sites had drifted in one at a time, each individually
#      reasonable, and a test that only checked the helpers would stay green through every one of
#      them coming back.
#
# Standalone (not sourced by selftest.sh) so it never touches selftest.sh's file-budget ceiling —
# same reasoning as selftest-e2e-phases.sh. Run directly, or via `make test-integration-selftest`.
# No server, no bench, no rig.
