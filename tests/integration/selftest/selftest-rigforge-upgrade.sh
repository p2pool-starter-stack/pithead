# Self-test for the one-click upgrade legs (rigforge-upgrade.sh), driven as pure functions against
# a stubbed TRANSPORT — no rig, no dashboard, no docker.
#
# Only `rx` is replaced. Everything above it — the dispatcher's branch choice, the shape assertions
# on the POST answer, the poll loop's terminal vocabulary, the accepted->applied settle, and
# _pred_rig_version_is reading the feed back — is the real code. Stubbing the higher-level helpers
# instead would have left the functions that carry this fix's whole point untested by the file
# whose job is to test them.
#
# In particular _pred_rig_version_is is NOT overridden. An earlier draft stubbed it to `true`, and
# that single shortcut made four cases report passes the real leg would never have produced: the
# noop follow-on fired after a FAILED upgrade, because the stub asserted the rig was on the new
# version when the whole point of the case was that it was not. The rig's reported version is now
# a file the transport reads, so "the rig came back on the new version" is a thing the fixture has
# to actually make true.
#
# THE BAR (#1237): the leg this replaces was green and proved nothing, so "these tests pass" is not
# the claim being made here. Every case below names the mutation it kills.
#
# Standalone (not sourced by selftest.sh) so it never touches selftest.sh's file-budget ceiling —
# same reasoning as selftest-rigforge-writable-keys.sh.
