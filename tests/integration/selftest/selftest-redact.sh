# Self-test for the redaction shapes successive issues found missing: #1582's two to begin with,
# then #1587's JSON form, #1590's casing, and #1596's positional addresses. Sections are labelled.
#
# redact() guarded two shapes — `KEY=value` for *_PASSWORD/*_TOKEN/*_SECRET, and v3 onion
# hostnames — and selftest.sh asserted exactly those four cases. So the coverage matched the
# implementation rather than the threat, and both gaps below were green by construction:
#
#   1. a credential passed as a FLAG value (`--rpc-login user:pass`). The KEY=value pattern
#      needs an `=`, so a colon-separated flag argument was never reachable by it.
#   2. a wallet address in JSON (`"wallet": "4…"`). Same reason — `"key": "value"` has no `=`.
#
# Both are live in `capture_artifacts`' bundle: the p2pool container logs its own argv, and
# `cat config.json` is captured verbatim. That bundle is what release-gate.yml uploads under
# the step name "Upload artifacts (redacted)".
#
# What makes this worth a file rather than a line: the artifact LOOKED redacted. The onion in
# that same argv line does get replaced, so a reader sees redaction visibly happening and reads
# the whole line as clean. A partial redaction is more dangerous than none, because it buys
# confidence it has not earned.
#
# The binding assertion in every case below is that the RAW value is ABSENT — not that a
# `<redacted>` marker appeared. A marker can appear because some OTHER field on the line was
# replaced, which is precisely the failure this file exists to catch.
#
# The pre-existing shapes stay covered by selftest.sh:202-210 and are deliberately not repeated
# here; that suite runs from the same Makefile glob.

MUST_SURVIVE="xvb.url workers.api_auth telegram.chat_id"
# ⛔ NOT a survivor on merit. `notifications.ntfy.url` IS a capability URL and ought to be
# redacted; a line-wise filter cannot reach it, because the key is the bare word "url" and only
# its NESTING distinguishes it from xvb.url. Asserted at its CURRENT behaviour so the gap is
# stated rather than hidden.
# ⛔ THE ARTIFACT EXPOSURE IS CLOSED (#1630); THIS ROW IS STILL TRUE, AND THAT IS NOT A
# CONTRADICTION. `capture_artifacts` no longer pipes the config document through redact() alone —
# it masks BY PATH first, using the box's own `render_masked_config`, so the topic never reaches a
# captured bundle. redact() ITSELF is unchanged and still cannot see nesting, which is what this
# row measures. So the pin does NOT move to MUST_REDACT: asserting redaction here would assert
# something false about the stream filter. The rows that measure the closed exposure live in
# selftest-capture-config.sh. Anyone closing the gap INSIDE redact() reds this line, as before.
# ⛔ THE .env HALF OF THIS VALUE WAS CLOSED (#1626); THIS ONE IS STILL OPEN. `NTFY_URL` fell to a
# specific suffix catching exactly itself. That does not transfer, because this key is the bare
# word `url` and only its nesting separates it from `xvb.url`. `ntfy_url` IS carried in both of
# redact()'s alternations, because #1611's invariant is that the two agree entry-for-entry — but
# measured against config.reference.json it reaches nothing, which is why this pin stays. The
# vocabulary entry is the price of the invariant, not evidence of coverage; this row is the
# evidence, and it asserts the value is NOT reached.
# ⛔ `notifications.webhooks[]` is the SAME gap one shape over, invisible here until #1723: the
# whole URL is the bearer secret (#848), redact() reaches no part of it, and the array ships empty
# so no walk produced a path to classify. The bundle is covered as ntfy.url's is, by
# render_masked_config's per-entry mask; this row measures the STREAM filter alone.
# ⛔ `xvb.standby.source` is the third of these, and it is a NAME gap rather than a shape one:
# `render_masked_config` masks it by path, redact() carries no suffix that reaches the bare word
# `source`, and until #1723 widened the screen this file could not see it to say so.

# corpus (48 distinct; a PER-CONTAINER partition puts every one in caddy, the only service here
# that logs JSON — the other nine contribute exactly zero), 16,107 in a live `api-state.json`, 62
# in a deployed `config.json`, and two archived bundles. The log corpus is live, so those two
# counts are a snapshot and moved between captures; the distinct-key set did not. Not
# one key in any of them carries a secret suffix in ANY casing, escaped or with a non-string value.
# Fixing an unreachable shape that never occurs is cost with no benefit; if one ever occurs, these
# two rows fail and say which shape arrived.
