# Self-test for `monero_caught_up`'s THREE answers (#1605, successor to #1597/#1603).
#
# THE DEFECT WAS ONE BIT OVER SEVERAL DOORS. `monero_caught_up` dials monerod's get_info with
# `curl -fsS … 2>/dev/null` and pipes the body into `jq -e`. Stderr was discarded and the body is
# EMPTY on an unreachable host, a refused connection, a timeout and a 401 alike — so `jq -e` over
# that empty body answered exactly as it does for a node that is genuinely behind. A caller could
# not tell "monerod says it is behind" from "monerod could not be asked", and #1597 established
# that this is most expensive where the bit feeds a SKIP CLASS, because a skip is an accepted hole.
#
# THE FIX IS AN rc, NOT A STRING, and it is deliberately open at the top end:
#
#     0        caught up
#     1        monerod ANSWERED and is not caught up
#     anything else   could not ask
#
# THE `[ -n "$body" ]` GUARD IS REDUNDANT WITH THE `case`, DELIBERATELY, and this is the note that
# stops a later reader deleting it as dead code or trusting it as the only mechanism. Measured:
# `jq -e` over EMPTY input exits 4, which the `case`'s `*)` arm already maps to 2 — so removing the
# guard changes no observable behaviour today. It stays because it states OUR protocol ("no body
# means we were not answered") rather than resting the classification on an entry in jq's exit
# table. The guard acts first, so the mutation that reds the empty-body rows is a mutation of the
# GUARD; the `case` is what would act if it were removed outright.
#
# The open top end is the whole safety argument. An empty body exits 2, but `rx` reaches the box
# over ssh and **ssh exits 255 when the connection itself fails** — so a mapping written as
# `!= 0 -> behind` would have booked an unreachable BOX as a node that is behind, re-creating the
# defect one layer up. Callers therefore test `= 1` for behind and let every other nonzero fall to
# could-not-ask. Part B below asserts that on the SHIPPED call-site lines, rc 255 included.
#
# HOW THIS FILE MEASURES. Part A runs the REAL snippet — `rx` in `IT_MODE=local` against a fake box
# directory, with a fake `curl` on PATH and the REAL `jq`. Nothing about `monero_caught_up` is
# stubbed, so the rows exercise the shipped text rather than a paraphrase of it. Part B lifts the
# two shipped classification lines OUT of run.sh by `grep` and `eval`s them against a stubbed
# predicate; it therefore cannot pass against a run.sh that has been rewritten back to two-valued.
#
# PROVEN ABLE TO FAIL — five mutations, each RE-RUN against the text that actually shipped, and
# each `cmp`-checked against an untouched copy first so a mutation that failed to apply cannot be
# counted as a leg. Measured, not predicted; the row counts are what the runs printed:
#   * lib.sh, revert to the old `printf … | jq -e …` (drop both the empty-body guard and the
#     explicit case)                                 -> 5 rows red, all in Part A (22/5).
#   * lib.sh, `|| exit 2` -> `|| exit 1`             -> 4 rows: the EMPTY-BODY arm only (23/4).
#     STATED, not hidden: those four are one code path behind four outside doors — ONE arm, not
#     four. The non-JSON row survives this leg, which is what proves the two arms are separate.
#   * lib.sh, `*) exit 2` -> `*) exit 1` (route jq's non-1 rcs to behind)
#                                                    -> the non-JSON row, and ONLY it (26/1).
#   * either call site -> `if …; then … else <one reason>; fi`  (re-run after the anchor change)
#                                                    -> that site's "behind and could-not-ask give
#     DIFFERENT reasons" row, and only it (25/1).
#   * site A's `elif [ $? = 1 ]` -> `elif [ $? != 2 ]`, routing 255 to the BEHIND arm and leaving
#     rc 2 alone                                     -> that site's ssh-255 row, and ONLY it (25/1).
#     That leg is what ATTRIBUTES the 255 row to its own arm rather than to the rc-2 row.
#
# The lift anchor is deliberately loose for the same reason — see the note at the grep below.
#
# A separate file because lib.sh and run.sh both sit ON their lint-file-budget ceilings (692 and
# 2551) and this change had to be line-neutral in both; the runner globs `selftest*.sh`
# (Makefile:29), so a new file needs no registration.
