# (20-doctor-install-checks.sh:27), and `capture_artifacts` puts that through redact() into

# IP has no secret NAME, no JSON key, and the >=90 SHAPE rule's alphabet excludes `:` and `.`.

# the addresses that make the artifact worth keeping. Loopback, RFC1918, link-local, CGNAT and
# CGNAT survive; globally-routable ones do not. Implementation is protect-then-redact: one
# dot of a reserved address is mangled to \x01, which breaks the quad so the redaction step
# cannot match it, and the last expression restores it.
