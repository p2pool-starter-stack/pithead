#
# Self-test: every path `render_masked_config` masks is CLASSIFIED by selftest-redact.sh (#1730).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The stack classifies config.json by PATH, in CONTROL_SECRET_PATHS
# (30-release-fetch-and-masked-config.sh) plus three jq array stanzas. selftest-redact.sh
# classifies the same document by a NAME screen over config.reference.json. Two classifications of
# one document, kept by hand, and nothing held them against each other — so they drifted, and the
# drift was found by someone happening to look: `xvb.standby.source` is masked by the product and
# was in none of the self-test's lists, because no suffix in either vocabulary carries the bare
# word `source` (#1723). This file is the check that fires instead of the next person looking.
#
# THE DIRECTION IS ONE-WAY, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE. This asserts product ⊆ self-test, never
# equality. The self-test classifies MORE than the product masks — public endpoints, routing ids —
# and it should; those are the rows a bundle exists to carry. What must not happen is the product
# calling something a secret that the self-test has never heard of, because such a field is
# outside the drift alarm entirely: nothing reds when it changes.
#
# THE POPULATION IS MEASURED, NOT LISTED. A parse of the CONTROL_SECRET_PATHS literal would see 12
# fixed paths and miss both variable-length array stanzas (workers.list[].token,
# notifications.webhooks[]), which are masked in jq rather than in the list. So this runs the REAL
# masker over a populated fixture and reads back which paths became {"__secret__": true} — 14 of
# them. (dashboard.workers[].token was a third stanza until 2.0.0 removed the alias, #1832.) The four classification lists are likewise read
# out of selftest-redact.sh rather than restated here; restating them is what drifts.
#
# ⛔ THREE THINGS THAT COST ATTEMPTS — each one silently produces a GREEN.
#
# 1. `render_masked_config` RETURNS 0 WHEN ITS jq FAILS. It warns on stderr, removes the temp
#    file, and falls off the end — so its rc is the warn's. A test that reads that rc passes over
#    a document that was never written, and every "is classified" row below then passes
#    vacuously over an empty population. THE ARMING CONTROL BELOW IS NOT OPTIONAL: assert the
#    ARTIFACT exists and carries the expected number of masked paths, never the rc.
# 2. THE FIXTURE MUST GIVE EACH ARRAY THE ELEMENT TYPE ITS STANZA EXPECTS. workers.list[] is an
#    array of OBJECTS — the stanza does `.token` on each element, so a string element makes jq
#    fail, and per (1) it fails quietly. notifications.webhooks[] is an array of STRINGS. config.reference.json ships all of them EMPTY and so cannot tell you this;
#    it has to be hand-specified, which is the same limitation #1723 hit from the other side.
# 3. DO NOT PIPE THE `source`. `source ./pithead 2>&1 | tail` runs it in a SUBSHELL, so
#    render_masked_config is undefined and CONFIG_FILE reads empty afterwards — which looks
#    exactly like the product being broken. Sourcing is safe (00-prelude.sh:98-101 sets
#    _STACK_SOURCED and skips the cd, the traps and main); EXECUTING ./pithead is the deploy trap.
#
# Every value in the fixture is synthetic.

# rows passing over an empty or unexpected population. It also makes this list load-bearing — a jq
# stanza added to the product without an entry here reds, rather than arriving unmeasured.
