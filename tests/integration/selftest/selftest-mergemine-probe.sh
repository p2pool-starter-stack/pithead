# Self-test for the p2pool -> Tari merge-mining round-trip probe (#1397) — the verdicts and the
# leg's three outcomes, driven from CAPTURED log bytes with no stack, no container, no network.
#
# The fixtures below were captured on the live stack, 2026-08-30, through the probe's own
# gesture (`docker compose logs --no-color --since <StartedAt> p2pool | head | grep`), escapes
# and service prefix intact. They are captured rather than hand-built for the same reason
# selftest-zmq-probe.sh captures its frames: a hand-built fixture agrees with whatever the
# author believed, so it cannot fail when the real wire format moves.
#
# The case that matters most is the VACUITY control. p2pool's log is ANSI-coloured and the
# escapes sit MID-LINE, between `MergeMiningClientTari ` and `tari://`. So the pattern anyone
# would write from reading the rendered log matches nothing at all — silently, and a probe that
# always says "absent" is indistinguishable from a working one until the day it matters. That
# control is fired in BOTH directions here: zero matches on the raw bytes, one after stripping.
