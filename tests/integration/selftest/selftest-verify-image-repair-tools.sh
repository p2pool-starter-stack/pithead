# Self-test for verify-image.sh's data-reset repair-tools check (#1069 W11).
#
# pithead-data-reset's repair chain (os/overlay/pithead-data-reset) runs
# `fsck`/`e2fsck`/`mkfs.ext4` behind `|| true`, so a rootfs that shipped without e2fsprogs
# would look exactly like a partition fsck refused to touch — nothing distinguishes "the tool
# is missing" from "the tool ran and said no". The check this covers catches that class of
# regression on the built artifact, driven here over a synthetic root tree — no image, no loop
# mount, no root, no bench.
#
# It lives here rather than beside verify-image.sh for the same reason selftest-verify-image-ref.sh
# does: that file sits at the 400-line target and a same-file test would cross it.
#
# Run: tests/integration/selftest/selftest-verify-image-repair-tools.sh
