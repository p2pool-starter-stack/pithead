# Self-test for `support-bundle`'s CONTAINER-LOG redactor (#1585, #1750).
#
# THE DEFECT. `stack_support_bundle` scrubbed container logs with one argv pattern naming three
# flags (`--rpc-login`, `--http-access-token`, `--tls-fingerprint`). The p2pool launch line it was
# written for carries three MORE secrets, verified at source in `docker-compose.yml:416-423` and
# `lib/pithead/36-quadlet-units.sh:233`: the Monero address after `--wallet`, the Tari address as
# the bare positional after `--merge-mine tari://<host:port>`, and the service onion after
# `--onion-address`. The same function's `.env` half already redacts WALLET and ONION keys, so one
# artifact shipped two policies — redacting these values out of `env.redacted` and back in through
# `logs/p2pool.log`.
#
# WHY POSITION AND NOT SHAPE (ruled on the issue, comment 5467691003). No length threshold reaches
# the Tari address: the three forms this repo validates are 91, 48 and 67 characters, the last
# non-alphanumeric, so a `{90,}` bar clears one by a single character and reaches neither other.
# Rows 2-4 below are that argument pinned — one row per form, all three killed by ONE positional
# rule that never looks at the value. The onion keeps its own SHAPE rule rather than being folded
# into a positional pattern, because it is the one value that also appears off the launch line.
# Keying on position is what `tests/integration/lib.sh`'s `redact()` has done since #1607, so the
# two redactors now key on the same property instead of drifting apart again (#1586).
#
# HOW THIS FILE MEASURES. It sources the REAL built `pithead` and calls the shipped
# `bundle_redact_log`. Nothing is restated here — a copy of the sed program in a test would be
# green by construction against itself. Sourcing is the shipped contract, not a trick:
# `00-prelude.sh:97-99` sets `_STACK_SOURCED=1` when `BASH_SOURCE[0]` differs from `$0` and skips
# every side effect (the cd, the traps, and `main`).
#
# EVERY ASSERTION HERE IS AN ABSENCE, WHICH IS WHY THE ARMING BLOCK IS NOT OPTIONAL. A source that
# failed would return empty output and green every row silently. The arming block proves the
# function is reachable before a single value is measured, and row 7 is a NEGATIVE control proving
# the filter is not simply blanking the line.
#
# The binding assertion in each row is that the RAW value is ABSENT — never that a marker
# appeared, since a marker can come from another field on the same line. Every fixture is
# synthetic and none is checksum-valid; they exercise LENGTH and SHAPE, which is all these rules
# read.

# --- BODY TEXT (#1750) --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE SECOND DEFECT, and why it needs a different KIND of rule. Every row above is a LAUNCH-LINE
# row: the redactor reaches those values by their POSITION in argv. #1736 gave this same and only
# redactor a second consumer — `diag-logs` and `diag-doctor` stream its output to a browser over
# the network — and p2pool also writes the payout wallet in ordinary body text (`Your wallet
# <ADDR> got a payout of ...`), where there is no argv position to key on. Demonstrated on the dev
# stack 2026-09-04.
#
# WHY A MONERO-ONLY SHAPE RULE IS TRACTABLE WHERE THE GENERAL ONE IS NOT. #1585 ruled out a length
# bar because the three Tari forms are 91, 48 and 67 characters and the last is non-alphanumeric,
# so no single bar reaches them without eating ordinary log tokens. Monero is the case that ruling
# leaves open, because its form is EXACT: prefix `4` or `8`, length 95 or 106, and the 58-character
# base58 alphabet that excludes `0`, `O`, `I` and `l`. That is precisely the shape gate
# `monero_address_type` applies before it decodes (25-address-types.sh), and the two have to stay
# in step — the "classifier agrees" rows below drive BOTH off the same three real addresses.
#
# NOT CLOSED HERE: a TARI address in body text still survives, by the ruling above. The launch-line
# rows keep their reach over the launch line; nothing in this section widens to Tari, and nothing
# should be read as though it did.
#
# LENGTH-EXACTNESS IS THE WHOLE SAFETY ARGUMENT, so it gets controls of its own: 94 characters, 96
# characters and a wrong prefix all SURVIVE. That is the same argument the onion row makes with its
# 55-character label. A rule that over-matched here would blank container ids and digests out of
# the one artifact support reads to find out what the stack was doing.

# Padded with `1`, which IS in the base58 alphabet — `0` is NOT, and a fixture carrying an
# out-of-alphabet character would make the SURVIVES rows pass for the wrong reason (the rule would
# miss it for a reason the row does not name). The arming block below measures alphabet AND length
# for every fixture before a single row runs.
