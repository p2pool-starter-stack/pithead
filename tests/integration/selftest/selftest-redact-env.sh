# Self-test for the `KEY=value` shape (#1611). A separate file because selftest-redact.sh sits
# just under lint-file-budget.sh's 400-line target; the runner globs `selftest*.sh`
# (Makefile:29), so a new file needs no registration.
#
# The defect was a DISAGREEMENT, not a missing spelling. redact() already treated `wallet` as a
# secret key name — in its JSON rule. On a `KEY=value` line only two rules could bite: a name
# rule listing three uppercase spellings, and the >=90-character length rule. So the same field
# carrying the same value was classified two ways depending only on the syntax it arrived in:
#
#     {"wallet":"4Short…"}           ->  {"wallet":"<redacted>"}
#     MONERO_WALLET_ADDRESS=4Short…  ->  MONERO_WALLET_ADDRESS=4Short…   (before this change)
#
# The fix keys the `KEY=value` rule on the JSON rule's own suffix vocabulary rather than adding
# one more spelling to a second list. selftest-redact.sh asserts mechanically that the two lists
# still agree, so this cannot drift back apart silently.
#
# MEASURED before it shipped, over `env.redacted.txt` in two archived bundles and the deployed
# `.env` (129 / 127 / 129 keys): the widening newly reaches exactly TEN keys, the same ten in all
# three populations, and changes NOTHING in the other six captured artifacts — zero lines across
# 307 KB of logs.txt, status.txt, doctor.txt, config.json, api-state.json and compose-ps.txt.
# That is the answer to the risk this change had to clear: the replacement takes the whole rest
# of the line, so a widened match could have stripped a debugging value. It reaches none.
# Six of the ten still carried a raw value under the redactor as it stood, a 64-hex Monero view
# key among them.
#
# Every fixture here is synthetic. The binding assertion in each case is that the RAW value is
# ABSENT — never that a `<redacted>` marker appeared, since a marker can come from another field
# on the same line.

# `--flag`, so the name rule is the only thing in redact() that can reach it: delete the rule and
# every row reds. ONE key per vocabulary entry that `.env` exercises, deliberately. The corpus
# showed six keys still leaking, but `TARI_SPEND_PUBLIC_KEY` and `DASHBOARD_ONION_CLIENT_PRIVKEY`
# both end in `KEY` like `MONERO_VIEW_KEY` — asserting all three is one measurement printed three
# times, and a single mutation killed all three together. They are named here instead.
# PASSWORD / TOKEN / SECRET stay covered by selftest.sh:202-210 and are not repeated. PASSWD,
# LOGIN and the rest have no `.env` field and need no forward-cover row of their own: the
# vocabulary invariant in selftest-redact.sh asserts this list IS the JSON one, so an entry cannot
# quietly go missing here without that check failing.
