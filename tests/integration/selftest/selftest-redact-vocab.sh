# Self-test for redact()'s coverage of the RENDERED `.env` population (#1621). A separate file
# because selftest-redact.sh sits just under lint-file-budget.sh's 400-line target; the runner
# globs `selftest*.sh` (Makefile:29), so a new file needs no registration.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS, and why it is not "one more spelling". #1596 was a redactor keyed to a LENGTH,
# failing on the input that was short. #1609 had no rule for an IP at all. #1611 was two
# vocabularies keyed to spellings that had drifted apart. #1616 unified them onto one list, which
# is the right fix and also means a name absent from that single list is now unreached by BOTH
# rules at once. Every one of those was found by someone looking; none was found by a test.
#
# A vocabulary is a denylist over a key set someone else keeps extending, so it fails silently and
# in the unsafe direction. This file is the check that fires instead: the population is DERIVED
# from the single heredoc `render_env` writes (33-render-env.sh), so a `.env` key added later
# cannot quietly go unclassified. The screen that selects candidates is deliberately BROADER than
# redact()'s own vocabulary — if the two were the same list, this file would be green by
# construction, which is the defect #1582 was found by and the one selftest-redact.sh guards
# against for config.reference.json. This is that guard, for the other population.
#
# MEASURED before it shipped, over all 129 rendered keys with both live rules: 19 redacted, 110
# surviving. Of the survivors, four carried a credential and were reached by nothing —
# DASHBOARD_AUTH_HASH_B64 (base64 of a caddy bcrypt hash, 80 chars), DASHBOARD_AUTH_PW_FP (an
# unsalted sha256 of the password, 64 hex), NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_URLS (webhook URLs, token-in-path) and
# DASHBOARD_AUTH_USER. That last one is the sharp one: three username fields, and two were reached
# only because the vocabulary carries `USERNAME` while this one ends in `USER`.
#
# ⛔ TWO ROWS THAT LOOK LIKE GAPS AND ARE NOT. `XMRIG_API_AUTH` renders `.workers.api_auth`, the
# enum none|name|token, and `DASHBOARD_ONION_CLIENT_AUTH` renders a normalize_bool() result, so it
# is literally `true` or `false`. Neither can carry a secret. They are pinned as SURVIVORS below,
# because adding a bare `AUTH` suffix would redact both and protect nothing — it would strip
# diagnostic state out of the bundle for no gain. Same for a bare `URL`, which would take the four
# public endpoints the bundle exists to carry and STILL miss NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_URLS (it ends `URLS`).
#
# Every fixture here is synthetic. The binding assertion for a redacted key is that the RAW value
# is ABSENT — never that a `<redacted>` marker appeared, since a marker can come from another
# field on the same line.

# Survivors, each for a stated reason. Over-redaction is safe for a secret and unsafe for anything

#   XMRIG_API_AUTH               an auth MODE enum (none|name|token), not a credential

# a topology question rather than a credential one, it is not what #1621 asked, and narrowing it
# here would strip the local-mode value that makes a bundle worth reading. Left surviving and named

# ⛔ `NTFY_URL` WAS pinned here as a known gap, on the reason that the bare word `URL` could not be
# added without taking every public endpoint above with it. True, and it was never the technique
# this file uses: a SPECIFIC suffix, measured against the whole rendered population. `NTFY_URL`
# catches exactly itself across all 129 keys, so it is now a MUST_REDACT row (#1626).
#
# ⛔ ITS JSON SIBLING DID NOT MOVE WITH IT, AND THAT IS NOT AN OVERSIGHT. `notifications.ntfy.url`
# stays a known gap in selftest-redact.sh for a DIFFERENT reason that measurement confirms: that
# key is the bare word `url`, and only its NESTING separates it from `xvb.url`, which a line-wise
# filter cannot see. `ntfy_url` is carried in BOTH alternations regardless, because #1611's
# invariant is that they agree entry-for-entry; on the JSON side it reaches nothing today. The
# two are the same VALUE and no longer the same GAP.

# Redacted, but by a SHAPE rule rather than the name rule — so a name-shaped sentinel would report
# them as leaking and be wrong. Listed separately BECAUSE that difference is invisible otherwise:
# a synthetic value cannot reach a shape rule, which is how a sweep over key NAMES reports a false
# gap. Each is asserted at the shape redact() actually keys on.
