# Self-test for the harness's ABORT TRAPS (#1401): WALKS every `*.sh` under tests/integration/ and
# asserts that each `trap` statement names `EXIT` and nothing else. It checked two hardcoded (file,
# handler) pairs until #1515, and the walk is the fix: measured, the two-site version stayed green
# against all three shapes that reintroduce the defect — a signal added to a file the change never
# touched, a brand-new selftest, and a second handler beside the guarded one inside e2e.sh itself.
# The scan is `*.sh` only; verified at the time of writing that no shell file under this directory
# lacks that extension, so nothing is currently out of reach, but one added later would be.
# The scan finds the population; a CLASSIFIER then reads each hit, and #1567 was two faults in
# that half — a handler strip that could not span the `'\''` idiom, and a `trap …` literal held
# as test data being asserted against as though this tree installed it. Both are fixed below, at
# `trap_line_signals` and `trap_hit_is_data`, which carry the rules rather than have them
# restated here — a recipe written in two places is one that drifts apart.
# Standalone (not sourced by selftest.sh) so it never touches that file's budget ceiling — the
# #1258/#1301 "moved into its own file" precedent. Run directly, or via
# `make test-integration-selftest`. No server needed.
#
# WHAT THIS EXISTS TO STOP, and why a comment alone would not have. `trap handler EXIT INT TERM` is
# the common idiom and it READS as more careful than bare `EXIT`, so it gets re-added by anyone who
# has not measured it. Measured here rather than assumed: a bare EXIT trap already runs when the
# shell dies of SIGINT or SIGTERM, so naming the signals adds no coverage — what it adds is that
# **a bash INT/TERM handler that RETURNS does not die.** The shell resumes at the next command.
#
# For e2e.sh that was a FALSE GREEN, not a redundant teardown: on a Ctrl-C or a cancelled CI job,
# restore_all ran the full unwind (miner pool restored, baseline stack redeployed), set its RESTORED
# guard, returned — and the run CARRIED ON, measuring the restored baseline stack instead of the
# branch under test, then exited 0. The guard is what made the second firing a no-op, so nothing
# unwound the continuation either. An aborted release-gate run reporting success is this harness's
# founding defect class, which is why the guard is a behavioural test and not a comment.
#
# THE CONTROLS ARE THE POINT. "Did the signal kill it" is unmeasurable without a row whose only
# correct answer is death: two plausible harnesses each reported a confident, wrong "it survived"
# before this one. An async job inherits SIGINT **ignored** and `trap - INT` cannot undo it (a signal
# ignored at shell entry stays ignored), and a bash waiting on a foreground child **swallows** a
# SIGINT the child never received — so signalling the shell's pid alone does not model a Ctrl-C.
# `set -m` fixes both: it puts each background job in its own process group AND leaves its signal
# dispositions at default, so the trial can signal the GROUP, as a terminal does. If the no-trap
# rows below ever stop dying, the instrument is broken and nothing under it means anything.

# THE HANDLER IS ONE SHELL WORD, AND A SHELL WORD IS A RUN OF CONCATENATED PIECES (#1567). Reading
# it as a single quoted run was the bug: `'echo it'\''s here'` is not one `'…'` but THREE pieces
# glued together with no whitespace between them — a quoted run, a backslash escape, a quoted run —
# because that escape is the only way bash lets an apostrophe inside single quotes. A one-alternative
# strip stops at the first inner quote and reads the remainder as the signal list, which reds a
# compliant line. The same fault hit `"echo \"hi\""`, a shape #1567 did not name.
#
# ANSI-C QUOTING IS ITS OWN PIECE (#1573). `$'a\'b'` is ONE word that bash reads as `a'b`, but
# the single-quoted alternative stops at that escaped apostrophe: it takes `$` + `'a\'` + `b` and
# reports the leftover quote as the signal list, redding a compliant line. Only `$'…'` needs an
# alternative — `$"…"` is a `$` followed by an ordinary double-quoted run, which the pieces below
# already read correctly.
#
# THE DIRECTION THAT MATTERS: this is more permissive than what it replaces, and a strip that goes
# too far eats the signals and reports `EXIT` for a line naming three — the #1401 false green, from
# inside the guard against it. It cannot: none of the five pieces matches whitespace outside
# QUOTING — the ANSI-C run swallows a space only inside its own `$'…'`, where bash agrees that space
# belongs to the handler — so the run always ends at the space before the signal list. The cases
# below pin that with a row for every shape carrying BOTH an escaped quote and extra signals; each
