# Self-test for the ZMTP PUB probe (#1497) — the verdicts, driven from captured and hand-built
# wire fixtures, with no socket and no stack.
#
# The probe exists because a bare TCP dial cannot tell a live ZMQ publisher from a
# docker-published port with nothing behind it. Proven on the bench 2026-08-29, one host, three
# targets, the preflight's exact gesture (`timeout 5 bash -c "</dev/tcp/host/port"`) beside it:
#
#   live monerod ZMQ 18083     preflight rc=0   probe: ok … Socket-Type XPUB
#   published-but-dead 28099   preflight rc=0   probe: no-greeting            <- the finding
#   closed 28098               preflight rc=1   probe: connect-refused
#
# The middle row is the whole point: the dial passes, the probe reds.
#
# These cases live in their own file because selftest.sh sits exactly on its recorded budget
# ceiling, and ceilings only go down.
