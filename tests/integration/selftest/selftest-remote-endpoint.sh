# Self-test for the remote-node endpoint overrides (#1491) — the ports resolve_overrides emits
# for monero.mode=remote, and run.sh's refusal of a host:port string.
#
# pithead renders monero.remote.host and monero.remote.rpc_port SEPARATELY
# (lib/pithead/99-remainder.sh), so a "host:port" passed as the host is appended to a second
# time and reaches the box as host:port:port. The harness could not express a non-default port
# at all before #1491, which is why remote mode could only ever be pointed at 18081/18083.
#
# These cases live in their own file rather than in selftest.sh because that file sits
# exactly on its recorded budget ceiling, and ceilings only go down.
#
# Run: tests/integration/selftest/selftest-remote-endpoint.sh
