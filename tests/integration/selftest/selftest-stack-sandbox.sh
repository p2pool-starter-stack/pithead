# Self-test for tests/stack/lib.sh's sandbox construction (#1661).
#
# THE DEFECT THIS PINS. lib.sh used to build its throwaway sandbox as a single expression:
#
#     SANDBOX="$(cd "$(mktemp -d)" && pwd -P)"
#     trap 'rm -rf "$SANDBOX"' EXIT
#
# `mktemp -d` writes its diagnostic to stderr and prints NOTHING on stdout when it fails, so the
# inner substitution collapsed to the empty string; `cd ""` is not an error in bash, it returns 0
# and leaves the working directory where it was, so `&& pwd -P` ran and SANDBOX became the
# directory the suite was invoked from. tests/stack/run.sh documents that as the repo root. The
# next line then armed `rm -rf` on the working tree, via an EXIT trap that fires at the end of a
# run that otherwise looked normal — every downstream "$SANDBOX/..." path resolved fine, because a
# real directory is exactly what SANDBOX held.
#
# WHY THE ASSERTIONS ARE SHAPED THIS WAY. Asserting only that the sourcing "failed", or only that
# some path came back, is green against the defect: the defective form succeeds and yields a real
# path. So the cases below assert the VALUE — that SANDBOX is not the caller's cwd — and assert
# that a sentinel file in that cwd is still on disk after the subshell's trap has run.
#
# The last case drives a reconstruction of the OLD expression against the same fixture and
# requires it to destroy the sentinel. Without it, every row here could be green because the
# fixture never armed rather than because the fix works.
#
# It lives here rather than in tests/stack/ because it is harness self-test, not one of the four
# tiers: the subject is the test harness's own plumbing and no product code is exercised. The
# tests/stack file that would otherwise host it, test-harness-tooling.sh, is not this lane's, and
# test-lifecycle.sh is at its 1032-line budget ceiling with zero headroom.
