# e2e.sh chooses.
#
# The defect it locks down is an ABSENCE, like #1364's. e2e.sh's own comment at deploy_branch says
# `pithead apply` "runs `compose up --pull` (never --build), so it would test whatever images were
# last built on the box, not this branch" — and the restore, at the other end of the same run, used
# exactly that pairing. On a box whose live install is a SOURCE CHECKOUT, `pithead` exports
# STACK_VERSION=dev (export_build_provenance, pithead:4149), so the baseline and the branch under
# test resolve to the SAME `:dev` tag; deploy_branch has already overwritten it, the source-checkout
# pull policy is `never`, and `apply && up` therefore brings the BRANCH back up under the baseline's
# name. Every other restore check stays green on that: the creds are read from the on-disk .env at
# runtime, monerod answers with them, and the control units name RESTORE_DIR either way. The run
# prints "restore complete."
#
# Two things are proven here, both against the SHIPPED files, never against a re-spelling:
#   1. grade_image_census classifies correctly, sourced straight out of restore-proof.sh.
#   2. restore_all, extracted out of e2e.sh and evaluated against stubs, picks `pithead upgrade` for
#      a source-checkout baseline and the cheaper `apply && up` for a release bundle.
# Then a mutation battery restores each defect in a COPY of the shipped module and requires the
# assertions to RED. A classifier that cannot fail is a grep, not a guard.
#
# Standalone (not sourced by selftest.sh), same reasoning as selftest-e2e-phases.sh. Run directly or
# via `make test-integration-selftest`. No server, no bench, no rig, no docker.
