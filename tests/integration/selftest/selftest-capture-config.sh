# Self-test for the config.json artifact capture (#1630).
#
# THE DEFECT. `capture_artifacts` wrote the live config.json through `redact()`, which is a
# LINE-WISE stream filter keyed on field NAMES. `notifications.ntfy.url` is the bare word `url`
# and only its NESTING separates it from `xvb.url` and the other public endpoints — so no name
# rule can reach it without also eating those. The ntfy topic in that path IS the capability:
# whoever holds a captured bundle can publish to, and subscribe to, the operator's channel.
# Measured on the shipped filter before this change, `notifications.webhooks[]` survived too —
# one value more than the issue names, and the whole URL there is the bearer secret (#848).
#
# THE FIX IS ROUTING, NOT NEW MACHINERY. The stack already classifies this document by PATH:
# `render_masked_config` (lib/pithead/30-release-fetch-and-masked-config.sh) walks
# CONTROL_SECRET_PATHS *plus* two variable-length array cases the fixed-path walk cannot reach
# (workers.list[].token and notifications.webhooks[]; the deprecated dashboard.workers[].token was
# a third until 2.0.0 removed that alias, #1832).
# The capture now SOURCES the box's own `./pithead` and calls that function, so there is ONE
# classification source and this harness restates neither the list nor the jq program. Sourcing is
# the shipped contract, not a trick: 00-prelude.sh sets `_STACK_SOURCED=1` when BASH_SOURCE[0]
# differs from $0 and skips every side effect — the cd, the traps, and `main`.
#
# WHY THE LIVE CONFIG AND NOT THE BOX'S PRE-RENDERED COPY: docs/dev/integration-testing.md, under
# *Artifacts & triage*. Stated once, there, rather than restated here.
#
# THE PASS IS ADDITIVE. The masked document still goes through `redact()` afterwards, so the shape
# and vocabulary rules keep their reach over anything the path list does not name; row 4 pins that.
#
# WHY THE SHIPPED LINE CARRIES ONLY ONE COMMENT LINE. tests/integration/lib.sh sits at its recorded
# 692-line ceiling with zero headroom, so the reasoning lives here and in
# docs/dev/integration-testing.md. The one comment line it does carry was paid for by deleting a
# comment that restated its own code.
#
# HOW THIS FILE MEASURES. It runs the REAL `capture_artifacts` from lib.sh against a fake box
# directory in IT_MODE=local, with the REAL built `pithead` and the REAL `jq`. Nothing about the
# masking is stubbed, so the rows exercise the text that ships rather than a paraphrase of it.
#
# PROVEN ABLE TO FAIL — the mutations and their row counts are recorded in the PR body; each was
# `cmp`-checked against an untouched copy first, so a mutation that failed to apply cannot be
# counted as a leg.
