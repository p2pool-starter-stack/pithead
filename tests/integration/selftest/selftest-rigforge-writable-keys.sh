# Self-test for the #1236 writable-key legs (rigforge-writable-keys.sh), driven as pure functions
# against stubs — no rig, no server, no docker.
#
# This file IS the lane's bar for #1236. A leg that goes SKIPPED -> PASSED without a demonstrated
# failure mode has been silenced, not fixed, so every assertion below is written to DIE if the
# behaviour it covers is removed: each one names the mutation it kills. The three refusals
# (autotune, watchdog, self-derived pools) are asserted the same way — as behaviour, by proving no
# apply payload ever carries those keys — because a refusal that lives only in a comment is a
# refusal one edit away from being undone silently.
#
# Standalone (not sourced by selftest.sh) so it never touches selftest.sh's file-budget ceiling —
# same reasoning as selftest-rigforge-apply-settle.sh (#1309) and selftest-compose-profiles.sh
# (#1301). Run directly, or via `make test-integration-selftest`.

# The rig detail the stubbed _worker_detail serves, and the log of every worker-apply payload the
# code under test POSTs. The payload log is what makes the refusals testable: a refusal is "this
# key never appears in an apply", which is a fact about the log, not about a comment.
#
# The log is a FILE, not a variable, and that is load-bearing rather than a style choice: the code
# under test calls _worker_apply inside `$(...)`, so a stub that recorded into a shell variable
# would lose every write to the command-substitution subshell and report an empty log — which
# reads exactly like "the code POSTed nothing", i.e. it would have passed all four refusal
# assertions while proving nothing at all. (It did, on this file's first run.)
