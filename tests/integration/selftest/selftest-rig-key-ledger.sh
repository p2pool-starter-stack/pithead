# Self-test for the abort-safe writable-key unwind (rig-key-ledger.sh, #1379) — no rig, no server,
# no docker.
#
# This file IS the lane's bar for #1379, and the bar is higher than usual because the thing under
# test is an INSTRUMENT: a trap that silently does nothing is indistinguishable from a trap that
# works, in a run whose whole point is that it did not reach its own cleanup. So every assertion
# below is written to die if the behaviour it covers is removed, and the two that matter most are
# driven in a REAL child process that REALLY dies — one by a non-zero exit, one by SIGINT — because
# a trap asserted by calling its handler by hand proves only that the handler is a function.
#
# The composition assertion (`rig_lock` + our trap) drives lib.sh's ACTUAL rig_lock against
# sandboxed RIG_LOCK_FILE/RIG_LOCK_HOLDER paths (rigforge#183 note 6), not a copy of it. That is
# deliberate: `rig_key_atexit` carries the only other copy of the holder-breadcrumb removal, and a
# test against a re-implementation would keep passing while the two copies drifted apart.
#
# Standalone (not sourced by selftest.sh) so it never touches selftest.sh's file-budget ceiling —
# same reasoning as selftest-rigforge-writable-keys.sh and selftest-rigforge-apply-settle.sh.
# Run directly, or via `make test-integration-selftest`.
