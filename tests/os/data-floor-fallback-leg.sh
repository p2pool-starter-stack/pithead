# The /data-floor fallback leg (#1672 — tier 4 for #1393). Sourced by tests/os/run.sh and run at the
# end of phase_provision, on the guest the migration leg just left committed: floor = this
# checkout's VERSION, chain services up, `mig_bundle` (a data_migration bundle at that version)
# already built. Proves the COMPOSITION the tier-1 rows cannot: a real migrating bundle whose
# boot gate fails, a real A/B fallback, and the previous slot's pithead-boot putting the floor
# back from the record the raise left — then the same sequence with the record deleted, which
# must leave the floor alone and make the guard refuse with the failed-update premise.
#
# HOW THE GATE IS MADE TO FAIL. The failing bundle is stamped $FLOOR_FALLBACK_VERSION, a version no
# release of this project will carry. Two consequences, both wanted: os-update treats it as a
# clean upgrade and raises the floor to it, and its slot boots deriving STACK_VERSION from that
# stamp, so `pithead up` hunts first-party image tags that were never published and cannot come
# up — exactly the effect the leg-4 note above _prev_patch_version in run.sh warns about, used on
# purpose here. pithead-boot then leaves the slot uncommitted and reboots into the previous one.
# The leg asserts the fallback by the previous boot's journal, not by the mechanism.
#
# WHY A COPIED TREE. Every bundle is stamped with the checkout's VERSION by design (mkbundle.sh:
# "deliberately has no override"), and the battery tree is frozen while it runs. So the failing
# bundle is built from a `git archive` export of HEAD with the version written into its VERSION —
# never a `git worktree`: the battery runs as root, and a root-made commit leaves root-owned
# objects in the .git every worktree on the box shares. The export has no git, so build-image
# stamps BUILD_COMMIT `unknown-dirty` and mkbundle needs PITHEAD_STALE_TARBALL_OK=1; os-update
# reads neither — only [meta.pithead]. It is signed with THIS tree's dev key (copied in) so the
# keyring baked into the guest's slots accepts it.
