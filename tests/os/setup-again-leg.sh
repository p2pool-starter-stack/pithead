# The boot menu's "Set up again" entry, tier 4 (#1318). Sourced by tests/os/run.sh and run inside
# phase_rig on the guest the reboot leg just left: a provisioned rig, mining, slot A committed.
# Three legs, each a boot from that entry. Keep it: the page closes and the rig mines again with
# the SAME token. Set up again as the same rig: the card shows the SAME token, so the coordinator's
# adoption survives. And after the update leg has moved the rig to slot B, Set up again as a
# coordinator: the role and its data are replaced — and the entry followed the default to slot B.
#
# The entry is chosen the way the running system would choose it: `grub-editenv set next_entry=3`
# in the ESP's grubenv, which grub.cfg consumes for exactly one boot. Never keystrokes on the
# serial console. The page's "Keep it" is the fixes lane's screen; here it is what that screen
# writes — an empty keep-role in the spool — touched over SSH. That proves the HOST half (the
# marker ends the session with nothing changed) independent of the SPA, which is proven at tier 1.
