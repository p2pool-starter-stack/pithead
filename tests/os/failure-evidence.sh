# backup_failure_evidence — the restore leg's source backup refused to complete (#1059).
#
# The known occurrence was `tar: data/pithead/config.json: Cannot stat` on a machine whose
# config.json was a present, root-owned regular file seconds earlier, with `.env` beside it
# archiving fine — and the guest was recycled before anyone could look, twice. What the CLI
# log alone cannot say is whether the file was RENAMED and by whom.
#
# The tree is the discriminator. Every path that removes config.json without touching .env
# lives in the firstboot wizard loop, and on an INSTALLED machine that has already accepted a
# config and brought its stack up, one of them is reachable: the setup-failure branch, which
# re-mints a token. (The rest are pre-setup validator rejections, or installer-STICK paths keyed
# on an install-request and /boot/efi.) `config.json.failed` on disk names that branch outright,
# and the spool beside it (error.txt, last-attempt.json) carries the reason setup failed.
# #1059's fix changed what that branch DOES, so read the dump accordingly. It was
# `mv -f config.json config.json.failed 2>/dev/null || rm -f config.json` — itself a mechanism
# for the vanish, and a failed mv deleted the file outright leaving no artifact. It is now an
# `install -m 600` COPY that removes the original only when `machine-role` is absent, so it no
# longer vanishes a coordinator's config.json — which makes a reported vanish a STRONGER signal.
# A `config.json.tmp` would instead name the credential write-back's atomic sibling.

# The #1059 watcher. It caught the mechanism on its first instrumented run, and stays as the
# canary for it: `setup` is still inside `stack_up`'s `compose up -d` when a concurrent
# `pithead backup` calls `stack_down`, which deletes a container out from under that in-flight
# `compose up`; it fails, `stack_up` calls error(), the `(setup)` subshell exits non-zero, and
# the firstboot wizard loop moves config.json aside (pithead:2746 -> :2752). Whether tar then
# reports `Cannot stat` is pure timing.
#
# It reports on PASSING runs too, and that is the load-bearing part rather than a nicety: the run
# that produced the capture above was one where the BACKUP SUCCEEDED and the config was moved
# aside anyway. A failure-only instrument would have printed a green tick. It follows that older

# `_ssh` is stubbed with a canned reply, which is the whole input this logic has.
#
# What it is here to prove is DISCRIMINATION, not that the code runs. The instrument's product is
# that its silence means exactly one thing, and five of the six outcomes above are "no evidence"
# rather than "nothing happened". If any two of them printed the same sentence, a run that watched
# nothing would read as a run that watched cleanly — the defect the instrument exists to detect,
# reappearing inside the instrument.
#
# So every case is asserted twice over: the sentence only that outcome writes must be PRESENT, and
# every other outcome's sentence must be ABSENT. Asserting on the shared
# "collected no evidence either way" tail would pass for any of the four, which is how one guard
# silently covers for another's deletion. Delete any branch below and its case goes red rather
