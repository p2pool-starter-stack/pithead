# Doctor check (#1141): does the certificate Caddy is ACTUALLY serving still cover the machine's
# name list, and is it still current? Appliance-only — DIY serves Caddy's own "tls internal" CA,
# out of scope here. With #1132's shared appliance_site_names() behind both the mint and the
# Caddyfile, a fresh render can no longer produce the two-different-rules mismatch by construction
# — this check is belt-and-braces for that half (a re-mint that silently failed, a hand-installed
# certificate, a stale one from before #1132) and the primary signal for expiry, which nothing
# else here re-derives on its own.
#
# Conservative on purpose: doctor is the second half of pithead-boot's health gate, and after
# #1065 a FAIL here reboots the box. An unreadable or truncated certificate file is a TOOLING
# problem, not proof the certificate itself is broken (a mid-write snapshot, a filesystem hiccup),
# so it WARNs; a FAIL is reserved for a certificate openssl actually parsed and found a concrete
# problem with — a host it does not cover, or a real expiry date.
#
# Coverage is split into two questions with two different honesty rules, because they need
# different evidence:
#
# The BASE name (appliance_base_name — a pinned dashboard.host, or this box's own hostname/.local)
# needs no live state to derive. An uncovered base name is always a real, actionable problem, so
# it can always FAIL.
#
# The rest is appliance_site_names' auto-expansion (only runs when dashboard.host is unset), and
# its membership can include one of pithead's OWN compose-bridge gateways. mining_net's is already
# excluded by appliance_site_names itself (a known config literal, ${NETWORK_PREFIX}.1); proxy_net's
# is NOT — #345: Docker/podman auto-assigns its subnet, so there is no literal to exclude it by, and
# telling it apart from a genuinely uncovered name needs asking the engine, live, right now (see
# appliance_bridge_gateway). pithead-boot mints the certificate at render, BEFORE `up` creates
# either bridge this boot; this check runs from doctor, inside pithead-boot's health-gate retry
# loop, AFTER `up` — so by the time this runs, both bridges normally exist and their gateways are
# in `hostname -I` whether or not the engine is reachable to explain them: bridge INTERFACES outlive
# an engine hiccup. Reading "the engine didn't answer" as "nothing to exclude" would manufacture
# exactly the FAIL this check exists to prevent — worse than the original bug, because it would
# come back intermittently, on a healthy box, disguised as a passing check. So: engine reachable
# for BOTH bridges -> filter the confirmed gateways out and FAIL on whatever is genuinely still
# missing, same as any other name. Engine did not answer for either one -> dr_warn once and skip
# the FAIL for every auto-expanded name this run — only the base name, which needs no engine at
# all, can still fail this boot.
