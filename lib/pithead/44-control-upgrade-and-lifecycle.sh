# Validate + dispatch one CLAIMED request file. Trusts no byte of it: must be JSON, only the keys
# id/action/config/actor/version, the id must be a UUID (it becomes the result/staged FILENAME —
# anything else is rejected before it can touch a path), and the action one of the three known verbs.
# Lifecycle verbs for the Telegram control commands (#338): the only two host actions the bot can
# trigger, both FIXED — `restart` runs `$0 restart` (recreate the running stack) and `apply` runs
# `$0 apply -y` (re-render + re-apply the CURRENT on-disk config.json). The container's `action`
# string only SELECTS between these two hardcoded commands; nothing from the request is ever
# interpolated into a command, and `apply` here carries no config change (the default-deny config
# allowlist is only relevant to a config-editing commit, not a re-apply of the source of truth).
# Since #2076 removed the Telegram control commands, NOTHING produces a restart/apply intent: the
# dashboard never submits either verb. The dispatch is kept because it is where "a spool writer
# cannot run an arbitrary host command" is proven and tested (tests/stack/control/
# test-control-lifecycle-verbs.sh), and because the spool already accepts the far more powerful
# `commit`, so removing these two buys no boundary. This side records the actor and outcome in the
# same tamper-evidence audit log.
