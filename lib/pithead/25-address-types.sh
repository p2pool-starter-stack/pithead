# Classify a Monero MAINNET address:
#   primary/standard  "4…" 95   — the ONLY kind p2pool can pay (coinbase) and XvB credits by.
#   integrated        "4…" 106  — embeds a payment id; p2pool rejects it.
#   subaddress        "8…" 95   — p2pool cannot pay a subaddress.
# Echoes: primary | integrated | subaddress | checksum | invalid  (#250, #829)
#
# Shape (prefix + length) alone is not enough: a well-shaped address with one mistyped character
# passes it, and p2pool then dies on the address at startup (SIGABRT/SIGSEGV) — a crash-looping
# stack that looks healthy from outside (#829). So after the shape gate, verify the address the
# way a wallet does: block-wise base58 decode, the network byte, and the 4-byte checksum — the
# first 4 bytes of the LEGACY Keccak-256 of the payload (Monero predates NIST SHA3; the padding
# differs, so sha3 tools give wrong digests and the hash is vendored below). "checksum" means
# exactly one thing: a character in the address is wrong.
#
# python3 does the math (bash has no 64-bit rotate worth writing): baked into the appliance
# rootfs, present on effectively every host that can run docker. Without it the shape verdict
# stands alone — the pre-#829 behaviour, degraded, not broken. Every config path routes through
# here (setup/apply, the appliance wizard spool, the dashboard control runner), so this is the
# one checksum gate for all of them.
