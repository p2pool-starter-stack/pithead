# The latest-release JSON for a GitHub repo, over the stack's own Tor SOCKS like every other
# stack egress. Prints the JSON and returns 0; on failure prints nothing, returns 1, and leaves
# GH_RELEASE_HINT holding the sentence the operator should actually be told.
#
# The reason this is a function and not two `curl -fsS` calls: `-f` collapses every non-2xx into
# one exit code, so a 403 came out as "could not reach GitHub over Tor" and sent the operator to a
# doctor run that correctly reports Tor healthy. GitHub's unauthenticated limit is 60 requests an
# hour PER IP, and a Tor exit is shared with everyone else using it, so a spent budget is a normal
# condition with nothing wrong with this machine — and a different remedy (pick a new exit) from a
# dial that genuinely failed.
# NOT stdout, deliberately: the JSON lands in GH_RELEASE_JSON and the caller runs this as a plain
# command. Assigning it through a command substitution reads naturally and is WRONG — that is a
# subshell, so the hint set here would never reach the caller and every rejection would carry an
# empty message. Two globals, one call, no subshell.

# result sat at "running" for ever with a single dial in the log. One derivation, one truth.
