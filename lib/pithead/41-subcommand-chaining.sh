# --- Subcommand chaining (#94) ---

# Every dispatchable subcommand, in help order. main's dispatch, the chain validator, and the
# tab-completion script (pithead-completion.bash) key off this one list; tests/stack/run.sh fails
# if any of the three drift apart.

# The subset allowed in a chain: commands that take no positional argument and terminate on their
# own. Excluded: setup (interactive first-run), logs (follows until Ctrl+C), restore (needs an
# archive path), reset-dashboard (destructive — run it deliberately, alone), test-alert (outbound
# messages), and the one-shot info/maintenance commands.
