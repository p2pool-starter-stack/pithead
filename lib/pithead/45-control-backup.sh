# One-shot encrypted backup + one-time "emergency kit" (#908). Reuses stack_backup UNCHANGED
# (~L2793), encrypted ONLY — no request field can pick --no-encrypt (it stays CLI-only), and a
# failure to mint a passphrase refuses before anything is touched, never falls back to plaintext.
# The passphrase is generated HOST-SIDE (generate_node_password: the same 32-char-alnum strength
# already used for the local node RPC creds) and crosses to stack_backup only through its existing
# PITHEAD_BACKUP_PASSPHRASE env-var input — the same channel an unattended cron backup already
# uses — never argv (what the support bundle's redaction targets, #77) and never a file.
#
# One-time handoff lifecycle: the kit (passphrase + archive name + contents + created-at/`ts`)
# rides back through the SAME results/ leg every other verb uses, keyed by the request id — but
# results/ is mounted READ-ONLY into the dashboard container (#33's trust boundary: it can only
# ASK, via requests/), so the container can never itself delete or ack this file the way the
# first-boot wizard's handoff/handoff-ack does (that spool is mounted read-write end to end). The
# deliberate substitute here: a bounded, blocking TTL. Short enough that a stuck backup doesn't
# stall the single-threaded runner's other queued verbs for long; generous next to the dashboard's
# own long-poll window (CONTROL_WAIT_S) so an ordinary page load always sees it. Once it elapses
# the passphrase is overwritten with null — read or not, it is gone. The archive/filename/contents
# stay: it is ciphertext, useless without the passphrase, so it remains downloadable.
# ponytail: TTL, not a container->host ack request (a "backup-ack" verb through requests/ would be
# more precise but is a whole extra verb) — add one if this window proves too tight/loose live.
# Backstop for control_backup's one-time kit: null the passphrase in any kit JSON whose `ts` is
# older than the TTL but which still carries one — the case where the runner was killed during the
# self-redaction sleep (a reboot racing the window) and left a wallet-grade secret in plaintext on
# /data. Run at the top of every drain, so the fresh runner after such a reboot cleans it up. A
# generous margin over the TTL (2x, floor 120s) so this never races the in-band redaction of a kit
# whose window is still open.
