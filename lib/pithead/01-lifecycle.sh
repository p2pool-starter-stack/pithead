# The Compose project name is pinned to "pithead" (docker-compose.yml `name:`). A stack first
# deployed under the old directory-derived project name still has containers holding our
# container_names (tor, monerod, …) under that old project — they'd block `up` with a name
# clash. Remove ONLY those — the containers belonging to the exact project THIS directory used
# to create — so the renamed project can take over. We never touch a container that merely
# shares a service name with us (e.g. someone else's `caddy` from an unrelated project). Chain
# data lives in the bind-mounted data dirs and the Tor onion keys in a bind mount too, so
# nothing is lost; Caddy re-issues its local TLS cert once under the new name.
