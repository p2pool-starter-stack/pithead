# --- Mutation lock (#1342) ---
#
# pithead had no mutual exclusion of any kind, so the writers on a box — the firstboot wizard
# loop, the host-side runner draining the dashboard's spooled intents, and an operator verb from a
# shell or a harness — could interleave with one another. The observed harm: a concurrent `backup`
# runs stack_down inside a still-running `setup`, setup fails for a reason that has nothing to do
# with the configuration, and the wizard treats that as a bad configuration (#1059).
#
# The lock goes around mutating WINDOWS, never around a whole verb. `backup` prompts for a
# passphrase and then for permission to stop the stack, `restore` asks before overwriting, and
# firstboot-wizard waits on a web form under TimeoutStartSec=infinity
# (os/overlay/pithead-firstboot.service:35). A verb-scoped lock would sit inside those waits and
# convert a race into a hang — the harder failure to read out of a journal, because a hang has no
# message.
#
# Re-entrancy needs TWO mechanisms, because pithead DOES re-invoke itself for mutating verbs
# (run_chain, control_lifecycle, control_backup):
#   - within one process (backup -> down -> up): a depth counter.
#   - across a re-invocation: an EXPORTED marker. The child inherits the descriptor across exec,
#     so the lock is already held on its behalf — but without the marker it runs its own `exec 9>`,
#     which opens a SECOND open file description on the same file and blocks on its own parent.
#     Both halves were confirmed against the tools rather than reasoned: a child's `flock -n` on
#     the inherited fd succeeds, and on a freshly opened one it blocks.
#
# fd 9 is a literal on purpose. Descriptors bash allocates itself (`exec {fd}>`) and any fd >= 10
# are close-on-exec, so a child would not inherit the hold; fds 0-9 named explicitly are not.
# Nothing else in this script uses fd 9. The lock lives on the descriptor, so the kernel releases
# it if the holder dies — which matters here because error() is an exit and several of these paths
# reach it.

# `$PWD/.pithead.lock` keys the lock on the directory pithead was run from — but the documented

# `current -> pithead-v1.5.0` sits beside `pithead-v1.4.0`, and the dashboard's one-click upgrade
# creates a third sibling and runs `./pithead upgrade` INSIDE it (control_upgrade). Every one of
# them drives the same Compose project (`pithead`, pinned in docker-compose.yml) against the same
# data dirs, so a directory-keyed lock leaves that upgrade and a concurrent `backup` mutually
# invisible — a lock that cannot be contended is #1059 again, wearing a green tick.
#
# So key it on the DEPLOY ROOT: the one thing every version dir of a stack shares. A plain

# Describe the holder of a window we could not take — and never name one we cannot show is still
# there.
#
# The record is written by whoever takes the lock and cleared by its release, but only an ORDERLY
# release clears it. A verb that is Ctrl-C'd, or that hits `error()` inside its window, leaves its
# line on disk: the kernel drops the flock with the descriptor, so the lock goes free while the
# record does not. A later waiter reading that line would be told to wait for a pid that exited —
# the exact misdiagnosis this message exists to prevent. The gap is narrow but ordinary: the next
# acquire truncates the record only AFTER it has taken the lock, so a third invocation that loses
# `flock -n` in between reads the dead line, and a holder that is not pithead at all (an
# operator's own `flock .pithead.lock`) never writes one and so never clears the dead line either.
#
# So the record is trusted only while the pid it names is alive. `/proc` is asked first because it
# answers regardless of who owns the process: `kill -0` returns non-zero on EPERM, and a root
# `pithead` holding the window against an unprivileged waiter is an ordinary case here, not an
# exotic one. `kill -0` is the fallback where /proc is not mounted. Anything that does not parse
# as our own `pid=<n>` record is reported as unrecorded rather than echoed back, because a line we
# cannot check is a line we cannot stand behind.
#
# What this does NOT cover, stated rather than implied: pid REUSE. A recycled pid reads as live
# and we would name the wrong holder — the same wrong name the code has without this check, in a
# far rarer case, and it costs a misleading message rather than a wrong action. The wait itself is
