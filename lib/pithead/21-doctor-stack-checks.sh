# The revenue-path containers, split by how they behave during a fresh node's DAYS-LONG initial
# sync (#35). This split is the whole reason the commit gate can tell "still syncing" (fine, commit)
# from "crashed" (revert):
#   chain nodes  — monerod/tari and their payout wallets. They RUN throughout the initial sync (they
#                  ARE what is syncing), and their healthchecks are liveness probes (RPC answers /
#                  process alive / #718 scan-grace), so they report healthy from early on regardless
#                  of sync height. A chain node that is down or unhealthy is a real crash, never
#                  "just syncing".
#   sync-gated miners — p2pool/xmrig-proxy. The dashboard deliberately STOPS these until the node
#                  finishes syncing (#35), so a DOWN miner is the expected steady state on a fresh
