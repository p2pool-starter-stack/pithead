# Scope is deliberately narrow: the CORE_KEYS_CONFIG shortlist (wallet addresses, monero.mode,
# p2pool.pool, dashboard auth) plus a few high-level "how should this run" shape questions —
# tari.mode among them (#1916), asked by wizard_ask_tari in the same place and the same three-way
# shape the browser wizard asks it, so the two setup paths cannot answer it differently.
# Everything else keeps its config.reference.json default, silently — see wizard_print_pointer.
# workers.list (also in the shortlist, #529) isn't asked inline: it's a variable-length list of
# per-rig objects, not a single answer, and the standard fleet needs no entries at all (see
# docs/workers.md) — so it's covered by the closing pointer instead of a prompt, matching the
# treatment #502 already prescribes for monero.view_key / dashboard.energy.cost_per_kwh.
# dashboard.host is asked separately, by resolve_dashboard_host "interactive" (setup(), after this
# function returns) — not duplicated here.

# The CLI wizard had no answer that meant "I do not merge-mine": it demanded a payout address and
# aborted without one, and it wrote no tari.mode, so an operator who did not want Tari had to know
# that tari.mode "off" existed and hand-edit config.json after setup. This asks the same three-way
# question the browser wizard asks, in the same order and the same place — after the Monero node
# question, before the pool tier (dashboard/.../wizard/setup.mjs) — so the two setup paths cannot
# answer it in different dialects. The Monero answer comes first for a second reason: it decides
# whether Monero's chain counts against the disk the default is derived from.
#
# A decline asks nothing further and stores no payout address: a machine that merge-mines nothing
# has nowhere to be paid, and parse_and_validate_config already drops the address from the required
# set when the mode is "off" (#1855). Sets TARI_MODE_WIZ, IN_TARI_WALLET, TARI_REMOTE_HOST,
