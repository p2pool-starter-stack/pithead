# --- OS update over the control channel (appliance A/B slots, dashboard-driven) ---------------
# The dashboard container only ASKS; every verb below re-derives, re-verifies and executes on the
# HOST, and every one refuses outright on a non-appliance host (no RAUC, nothing to update).
# The flow is deliberately staged — check, download (resumable, to /data), verify the LOCAL file,
# install the verified local bundle, then an EXPLICIT reboot — so every network step is separated
# from every destructive step and a bundle is never stream-installed over Tor.

# Tor SOCKS, which cannot reach the bench). The ownership check stops a non-root plant from
# steering root's downloads; verification still runs for real against the slot keyring either
# way, so the seam can redirect WHERE the bytes come from but never what installs.
