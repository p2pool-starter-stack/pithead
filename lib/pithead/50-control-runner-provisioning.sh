# fine because these units are derived and the boot path re-renders them. A DIY host keeps /etc.
# This was two rules until #1151: `provision_control_runner` knew about /run and `doctor` did not,
# so on a PROVISIONED appliance doctor reported "no runner units are installed" about units that
# were installed and running. That is the half of the boot health gate that never passed, so the
# slot never committed — and after #1065 the box reboots a healthy, correctly-updated appliance.

# Pin the engine (#2059). A systemd unit does NOT read /etc/environment — that is PAM, for login
# shells — so the appliance image's own PITHEAD_ENGINE pin never reaches a unit, which is why
# pithead-boot, pithead-firstboot and pithead-setup-again each set it explicitly. This unit is
# rendered here rather than shipped in os/overlay/, and it was the one that did not.
#
# Without it container_engine() falls through to probing, and the probe prefers docker — which
# EXISTS on the appliance, as podman-docker ships /usr/bin/docker as a shim onto podman. So every
# dashboard-driven apply took the DOCKER branch on a podman/netavark box: it deleted the live
# inet pithead_egress table and reinstalled the rules into DOCKER-USER, a chain netavark never
# jumps to, leaving clearnet egress fail-open with the boot log reporting it enforced. That is
# #855's failure mode arriving through the one path #855 did not cover.
#
# DETECTED, never hardcoded to podman: the same renderer runs on the DIY channel, where docker is
# the correct answer. What the unit inherits is whatever the install itself was provisioned with.
