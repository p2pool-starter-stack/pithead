# --- Diagnostics (doctor) ---
#
# A strictly READ-ONLY health report: the "run this and paste the output" command for support
# threads. It never modifies files or the system, and never hard-exits mid-run — every check is
# guarded so a missing tool or unreachable service can't abort it. Each check prints one
# OK/WARN/FAIL line with a short hint; a summary follows. It works whether or not the stack is
# deployed (env-dependent checks degrade gracefully when .env is absent), and Linux-only probes
# (e.g. /proc/meminfo) are skipped on macOS dev hosts.

# Per-run tallies for the closing summary. Reset at the top of doctor().

# One verdict, worded for the surface the operator is actually on (#1213). Doctor's messages reach
# the dashboard verbatim since the diagnostics verbs landed -- control_diag_doctor runs
# `doctor --json` and every dr_fail/dr_warn message ships as {status, message} -- so a remedial
# string naming a CLI verb is a dead end on an appliance, which has no shell. That is the defect
# class the refusal strings were already fixed for; these are the same treatment for doctor.
# First argument is the DIY/host wording, byte for byte what it always was. The second is what an
# appliance operator is told instead, and it NEVER invents a remedy: it names a dashboard surface
# only where one exists (the setup page, the one-click upgrade, the per-container log view) and
# otherwise states the diagnosis and stops -- the same choice describe_change makes when there is
# no remedy to offer. is_appliance resolves at call time, as it already does elsewhere here.
