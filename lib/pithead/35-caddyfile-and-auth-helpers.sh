    #    own default is a reflecting redirect on :80 (closed by #1123) and an empty 200 on :443 —
    #    `content-length: 0`, no body, so a browser just shows a blank page (#1132's third bullet:
    #    the certificate/site-list mismatch this closes made that page's Host land HERE, not on the
    #    real vhost, and this was the only piece of the mismatch that stayed silent). Refusing
    #    outright would read as a dead machine, same reasoning as the :80 catch-all.
    #  - the :443 catch-all carries NO `tls` line of its own: it has no hostname in its address for
    #    Caddy to manage a certificate against, and needs none — proven with `caddy adapt` against
    #    the rendered file, a catch-all with no per-block TLS policy falls through to the file's
    #    default connection policy, which serves whatever certificate the named vhost below already
    #    loads (the appliance's minted file, or DIY's `tls internal`). A matching SNI never sees
    #    this block at all; an unmatched one completes the handshake against that same certificate
    #    (a name mismatch the browser will flag, honestly) and gets the redirect below instead of
    #    a silent 200.
    #  - and ALL of these carry the same bind list as the vhosts above. A site block with no bind
    #    asks Caddy for a WILDCARD listener, which would reopen every address the bound blocks were
    #    written to exclude — the globally-routable one included (#1021). That is the whole hazard
