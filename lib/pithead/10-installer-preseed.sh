# the installed machine. Config is never transplanted between machines.

# Overridable so the shell suite can point it at a fake — the real one partitions disks.

# flashing — before the machine has ever booted. Two are honoured:

#   pithead-token.txt     a chosen one-time token, so a box with no display can be reached
#
# This is what makes a headless or fleet install possible at all: without it the token exists
# only on the console, so every machine needs a monitor walked to it once.

# the fixed paths cannot reach), alert credentials, the ssh key. Wallet addresses, node modes
# and hosts, the pool tier stay: those are the answers the operator came back for, and none of
# them is a secret. Errs toward stripping more — a lost convenience beats a leaked credential.
#
# The two ENABLEMENTS go with the login, and that is the half this was missing (#1846). The
# validator fails closed on dashboard.control.enabled and on dashboard.onion.enabled whenever
# the password is empty — deliberately, since both are reachable control surfaces. Deleting the
# login while leaving either switch on therefore publishes a pre-fill that CANNOT be submitted:
# the page offers it back, "Generate a strong password for me" leaves the password empty because
# the HOST generates one only AFTER the candidate has validated, and the first validation refuses
# the operator's own answers. Dropping control.enabled costs nothing — apply_appliance_defaults
# puts it back on any appliance whose password is non-empty. onion.enabled the operator re-ticks,
# which is the same trade the paragraph above already makes.
