# --- the machine role (one stick, three machines) -------------------------------------------
# What a machine IS is the wizard's first question: a Pithead coordinator, a coordinator that
# also mines (Both), or a RigForge rig. config.json states the coordinator roles exactly — Both
# IS local_miner.enabled — so the marker is derived from it there. The rig role has no
# config.json at all, which is why the marker, with rig.json beside it, exists: the boot path
# reads machine-role to know which leg to start. Absent marker = pithead (every machine
# provisioned before this contract).

# The wizard's response to a failed (setup), as one step so it can be driven directly (#1059).
#
# It KEEPS the machine's configuration. A non-zero (setup) says something went wrong, never that
# the submitted config is what went wrong — the capture that found this was a concurrent `backup`
# calling stack_down out from under setup's in-flight `compose up`, on a config valid enough to
# have rendered .env, provisioned Tor and started containers.
#
# This used to MOVE the file, to re-arm the setup wizard. It cannot, on any path that reaches it:
# pithead-firstboot.service ANDs !config.json with !machine-role, and record_machine_role above
# has already run, so the second condition holds the window shut whatever this does with the
# first. Keeping the file also keeps the next boot working — pithead-boot.service's conditions
# are ORed so it runs regardless, and os/overlay/pithead-boot's `./pithead render` reads exactly
# the file the move used to take away.
#
# The removal therefore happens only where it can still buy something: a machine-role that never
# landed (record_machine_role is best-effort). It lives INSIDE the success branch on purpose —
# the defect this replaced was `mv ... 2>/dev/null || rm -f config.json`, which deleted the
# operator's configuration outright whenever the mv failed, for a reason it had already
# discarded. Structurally, nothing here can remove the file without a copy already on disk.
#
# install -m 600, not cp: config.json holds the dashboard password and the wallet address, and
# the copy must not widen its mode.

# CONTENTION IS NOT A BAD CONFIG — the wizard's half of #1342's routing, and it was missing.
#
# os/overlay/pithead-boot has the boot leg's half (fail_boot_contended): a lock timeout there is
# contention, not a bad A/B slot, so the fallback is not spent. `setup` runs inside a mutating
# window too, and can lose exactly the same race — but every non-zero (setup) was routed as a
# provisioning failure, which tells the operator their configuration is wrong and asks them to
# correct it. On a first boot there is no shell to contradict it with.
#
# Worse than misleading. That path calls wizard_keep_failed_config, which removes config.json
# whenever the machine-role marker never landed — and record_machine_role is best-effort
# (`printf ... || true`). So contention could take a VALID configuration away from the operator
# and then blame them for it: #1059's own shape, on the one leg #1059's fix did not route.

# the other leg: the two halves of one decision drift apart when they are written twice.
