# Read-only diagnostics over the control channel (#913 doctor detail, #943 log tail). This slice
# is named `46a-` deliberately: the build concatenates lib/pithead/*.sh in LC_ALL=C order
# (scripts/build-pithead.sh), which places it AFTER 46-control-worker-ops.sh and BEFORE
# 47-os-update-helpers.sh, i.e. at the end of the control-verb family where it belongs — but a
# plain `ls` under a UTF-8 locale sorts `46a-` BEFORE `46-`, so what you see in a directory
# listing is not the order the artifact is built in. Trust the C-locale sort, not the listing.
#
# Both verbs are ASKS with no host mutation: they read and report. That is what lets them skip the
# approval gate every mutating verb goes through. Neither takes a string that reaches a command —
# the container names a container from the FIXED allowlist below and a line count that is clamped
# host-side, and nothing else crosses.
#
# WHY THE APPLIANCE NEEDS THIS: an appliance operator has no shell. Today they can see THAT a
# service is unhealthy and never WHY, and their only recourse is the support bundle or the console.
#
# REDACTION: bundle_redact_log (07-support-bundle.sh) is the ONLY redactor on this slice, and it
# guards BOTH verbs — the log tail and the doctor document. It is reused rather than reimplemented
# on purpose: that function's own header records the ruling that a second list is how the two
# drift apart, and it carries #1585's per-form address rows. Anything either verb must newly
# redact belongs in bundle_redact_log, where the support bundle gets it too — which is how #1750
# was fixed, and it is the reason this slice has no rule of its own to read.
#
# THE ALLOWLIST IS NARROWER THAN THE COMPOSE SET, AND THAT IS THE POINT. `wallet-rpc` and
# `tari-wallet` are compose services this verb deliberately REFUSES. bundle_redact_log reaches the
# launch-line leak class — the credential flags and addresses services echo in argv on startup —
# plus the two values it can also recognise ANYWHERE by shape, the onion and (since #1750) the
# Monero address. The wallet daemons are precisely the two whose ordinary output is most likely to
# carry key and address material in shapes outside all of that: a Tari address in body text has
# three valid forms and no shape rule reaches them all, which is #1585's standing ruling. The support bundle may collect them because
# it lands as a chmod-600 tarball the operator reviews before sharing; this verb streams to a
# browser over the network, which is a different trust context for the same bytes. An operator
# debugging a crash-looping wallet still has the support bundle and the console.

# Hard caps, enforced HOST-SIDE in the verb rather than by the caller: a bound the client asks for
# is not a bound. Lines match the support bundle's own --tail 200. The byte cap is the one that
# actually protects the runner and the results spool, because a single log line has no length
# limit — a service echoing a megabyte on one line satisfies any line cap.

# `doctor --json` for the dashboard (#913). Runs as a CHILD PROCESS for the same reason
# control_backup does: doctor's own error paths exit the process, and that must not take the
# single-threaded drain loop's other queued requests down with it. doctor's rc is the failure
# COUNT, not a run failure, so a non-zero rc still carries a valid document.
#
# THE DOCTOR DOCUMENT IS REDACTED TOO, and it is not obvious that it must be. doctor writes its
# report for the CLI, where the reader is the operator: `Dashboard onion:` prints the address in
# full on purpose (06-doctor.sh), because someone at a terminal needs it. That is the right call
# there and the wrong one here — this document crosses into the container, which is the party the
# whole channel is built not to trust, and the hidden-service address is the one value whose only
# security property is that nobody has it. The support bundle carries the same document unredacted
# because it lands as a chmod-600 file the operator reviews before sharing; same bytes, different
# trust context, same distinction the log tail already makes.
#
# It goes through bundle_redact_log — the same and only redactor the log tail uses — rather than a
# rule of its own, so a value added there is covered on both paths. Redacting JSON as text is safe
# for the onion rule (a fixed-shape match that cannot touch a quote), and the `jq -e .` check below
# is the backstop if any other rule ever did break structure: the result would be a refusal, not a
# leak.
