# --- Tor-only egress enforcement (#270) ---------------------------------------------------------
# Fail-closed host firewall so a misconfigured/buggy bridge daemon (monerod/p2pool/tari/xmrig-proxy)
# CAN'T leak the home IP: each may reach the LAN, the other containers and the Tor SOCKS, but any
# DIRECT clearnet dial is DROPPED — only the `tor` container reaches the internet. Rules live in
# Docker's DOCKER-USER chain (preserved across Docker restarts), installed BEFORE containers start on
# every path that brings a clearnet-capable app up — `up`, `upgrade`, `apply`, `reset-dashboard` (so
# there is no startup window to grandfather a leak past) — and removed at `down`. Needs
# root (sudo), like the GRUB/HugePages steps. The allow-set is IPv4 (mining_net is IPv4-only by
# design); the nft backend also fences IPv6 off the mining bridge if mining_net ever gains a v6
# subnet, so the backstop can't silently fail open. Opt out with
# network.tor_egress_firewall=false. Proven by tests/integration/benchmarks/bench-verify-egress.sh.
# See docs/privacy.md.
#
# Two enforcement backends, one allow-set. Docker adds a `FORWARD -> DOCKER-USER` jump when it
# creates a network, so on the DIY/Docker channel the rules live in DOCKER-USER (iptables). The
# appliance runs podman + netavark, which never adds that jump — DOCKER-USER is orphaned there and
# the DROP never fires. On the podman path we instead install an independent `inet pithead_egress`
# nftables table hooked at forward priority -5 (ahead of netavark's priority-0 accept), owning no
# chain shared with netavark so it survives netavark reprogramming its own table. apply/remove/doctor
# all branch on container_engine.

# Full `nft -f` ruleset for the appliance/netavark path — same allow-set as tor_egress_rules, in
# native nftables. Pure (args only) so it unit-tests. `add`+`delete` before the table body is the
# canonical atomic idempotent-replace: `add table` no-ops if it already exists, `delete` then clears
# it, and the block recreates it fresh — the whole file loads as one transaction. The base chain is
# hooked at forward priority -5 so it evaluates before netavark's priority-0 blanket accept; a `drop`
# there is terminal across the ruleset. accepts come first so LAN/Tor/established traffic skips the
# final subnet-wide drop, mirroring the iptables order.
#
# The optional third arg is the mining bridge interface. mining_net is IPv4-only by design, so it is
# empty on every normal apply and the ruleset stays v4-only. If mining_net ever gains an IPv6 subnet
# the caller resolves the bridge and passes it here, which appends the v6 fail-closed backstop: there
# is no assigned v6 range to source-match, so the drop is keyed on the mining bridge INTERFACE — the
# host's own IPv6 forwarding on every other interface is left untouched.
