# `support-bundle` (#77 phase 1): most support is log collection — one command gathers what a
# report needs into a chmod-600 tarball the operator reviews before sharing. Read-only; nothing
# leaves the box. Secrets are redacted at the source: config via the control channel's masking
# (render_masked_config), .env by key pattern, container logs by argv position — p2pool echoes its
# --rpc-login, both wallet addresses and the service onion on launch, the leak class this exists to
# stop. The membership of that class was drawn too narrowly until #1585; add to bundle_redact_log,
# not to a second list.

# Keyed by POSITION and not by shape, which is #1585's ruling: no length bar reaches all three Tari
# address forms this repo validates (91, 48 and 67 characters, the last non-alphanumeric), and a bar
# low enough to try starts eating ordinary log tokens. The onion keeps its own shape rule — it is
# the one value that also appears away from the launch line. The .env half of this bundle has always
# treated wallets and onions as secrets, so leaving them here shipped one artifact under two
# policies. Per-form rows and the full derivation: tests/integration/selftest/selftest-bundle-redact-log.sh;
# tests/integration/lib.sh's redact() keys on the same property (#1607) and the two stay in step.
#
# THE MONERO ADDRESS IS THE ONE VALUE THAT ALSO NEEDS A SHAPE RULE (#1750). Position is enough for
# an artifact the operator reviews before sharing; #1736 gave this same and only redactor a second
# consumer — `diag-logs` and `diag-doctor` stream its output to a browser over the network — and
# p2pool writes the payout wallet in ORDINARY BODY TEXT as well as on its launch line ("Your wallet
# <ADDR> got a payout of ..."), where there is no argv position to key on.
#
# This does NOT reopen #1585. That ruling is about a GENERAL address rule, and it stands: Tari has
# three forms at 91, 48 and 67 characters, one of them non-alphanumeric, so no bar reaches them all.
# Monero is the case it leaves open, because the Monero form is EXACT rather than approximate —
# prefix `4` or `8`, length 95 or 106, over the 58-character base58 alphabet that excludes 0 O I l.
# That is the same shape gate monero_address_type applies before it decodes (25-address-types.sh),
# and the two are held in step by the "classifier agrees" rows in the self-test, which drive both
# off the same real addresses. A TARI address in body text still survives; that gap is stated, not
# closed.
#
# WHY THE RULE IS APPLIED TWICE. POSIX ERE has no lookaround and BSD sed — a supported host, see
# safe_sed — has no \b, so the boundary characters either side have to be MATCHED, and matching
# them consumes them. Two addresses one space apart therefore need two passes: the first eats the
# space that is the second address's left boundary. Two is sufficient for any count, because after
# one pass every survivor is preceded by the replacement text. The self-test's adjacency row is the
# control: drop either -e and it reds alone.
