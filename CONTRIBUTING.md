# Contributing to Pithead

The workflow for contributing bug fixes, docs changes, and features.

## Before you start

- Use the [repo map](docs/dev/repo-map.md) to find a feature and its tests.
  The [AI workflow](docs/dev/ai-workflow.md) adds scope, log, and handoff rules for agents.
- Open an issue before writing code for anything beyond a small fix. Discuss the approach
  there first.
- Check the [open issues](https://github.com/p2pool-starter-stack/pithead/issues) for existing
  work on the same thing.
- This project follows a [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md); by participating you agree to uphold it.

## Dev environment

The dashboard uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management; a hashed
`uv.lock` pins every transitive dependency for reproducible installs. Its Python tooling
([`ruff`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) lint + format, [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/))
lives in the `dev` extra. Install uv, then from the repo root:

```bash
uv sync --project dashboard --extra dev    # deps + tooling into dashboard/.venv, from the lock
uv run --project dashboard pre-commit install
```

`make test` and `make lint-py` run through uv automatically (no venv to activate); `pre-commit`
runs `ruff` (plus a few hygiene hooks) on your changed files. If you change dependencies in
`dashboard/pyproject.toml`, run `uv lock` and commit the updated `uv.lock`.

The root `pithead` executable is generated and git-ignored. Plain `make` builds it from the
numbered `lib/pithead/*.sh` sources; the test targets also build it when needed. Edit the slices,
not the generated file.

The full shell and appliance selftest suite expects **Linux and a non-root user**, as in
CI. It uses GNU utilities and tests permission failures that root would bypass. Install
Bash, Git, Make, jq, Node, Python 3, e2fsprogs, and the shellcheck/shfmt versions pinned in
`Makefile`. On macOS or Windows, run these suites in a Linux VM, container, or WSL;
the dashboard and frontend unit suites can run on the host.

## Development workflow

1. Fork the repo and create a branch off `develop` (the integration branch; `main` holds released
   commits only — it fast-forwards to each release's tagged commit, see
   [Releasing › Branch mechanics](docs/dev/releasing.md#branch-mechanics)).
2. Make your change. Keep it focused: one logical change per PR.
3. Run the full test suite locally:

   ```bash
   make test
   ```

   This runs everything CI does that doesn't need a live test server:

   - **lint** — every file surface gets a linter/formatter check (`make lint` runs them all; run one
     with `make lint-<surface>`): `lint-sh` (shellcheck + shfmt), `lint-py` (ruff), `lint-js` (Biome),
     `lint-yaml` (yamllint), `lint-md` (markdownlint), `lint-docs-voice` (banned-word check),
     `lint-path-references` (every repo path named in a comment, docstring or doc has to resolve — a
     reorganization moves the target and leaves the pointer, and nothing else here notices; deliberate
     absences go in the script's own `allowed_absent()` with a reason, never a per-file exemption),
     `lint-operator-strings` (no issue/PR numbers in operator-facing `pithead`/dashboard text, and
     no bare `docs/` paths in `pithead` operator text — release bundles carry a curated operator-doc
     subset, not arbitrary repo paths, so point at `$DOCS_URL/docs/<file>.md#anchor` instead; comments
     keep the plain path),
     `lint-topology` (no real-looking IPv6/IPv4 literal, `/home/<name>` path, `.lan`/`.internal`/
     `.local` hostname, or `user@host` string — a public repo, so every one of those has to stay a
     generic class, not a trace of whoever's actual box; `tests/` and `docs/` are an accepted
     exemption boundary for illustrative/fixture content, and each class also carries a small,
     explicit value-level allowlist — see the script's own header — never a per-file exemption
     comment), `lint-file-budget` (the file-budget ratchet, issue #1105 Phase 0 — see
     [File budget gate](#file-budget-gate)),
     `lint-pithead-build` (the generated `pithead` must build from `lib/pithead/*.sh` in a clean
     checkout — issue #1105 Phase 2), `lint-trivy-parity` (the CVE
     gate's two trivy-action steps and `scripts/watch/trivyignore-watch.sh` must name one trivy engine
     version — issue #1290), `lint-proto` (buf),
     `lint-toml` (taplo). The
     non-Python tools run via `npx`/`uvx`/`docker`, so a contributor needs **Node, uv, and Docker**
     on PATH (plus `shfmt`); `pre-commit` runs the same checks on changed files. Link-checking
     (`lychee`) runs on a weekly schedule, not per-PR.
   - **test-dashboard** — the dashboard `pytest` suite (must stay ≥ the **80% total coverage gate**).
     CI also runs **`make test-patch-coverage`** (`diff-cover`): new/changed lines must be **≥ 90%**
     covered against the PR's own base branch, the ratchet that stops coverage rotting at the margin. The gate
     says so explicitly when a diff has nothing it measures (shell/docs-only PRs pass loudly), and
     fails if a changed dashboard Python file is missing from `coverage.xml` entirely — the
     silent no-op it used to be. Run it right after `make test-dashboard`, so `coverage.xml`
     is fresh.
   - **test-frontend** — the frontend logic tests (`node --test`); uses the same Node that the
     lint surfaces already require.
   - **test-stack** — the `pithead` shell test suite.
   - **test-compose** — `docker-compose.yml` interpolation validation.
   - **test-integration-selftest** — the integration harness's own pure logic.
   - **test-tools** — bounded build-log sanitization, without running a build.
   - **test-fakes** — the tier-2 contract test (real dashboard clients vs controllable fakes).

   Bigger, infra-dependent suites run separately: `make test-mini-stack` (tier-3 docker) and
   `make test-integration` (tier-4 live, against a real box; start with `--check`).

4. Add or update tests for your change. Cover the *intent* (a behavior/contract), not just
   the line. The [Testing Guide](docs/dev/testing-guide.md) has per-change recipes; the
   [Testing Strategy](docs/dev/testing-strategy.md) explains the tiers.
5. Update the docs in [`docs/`](docs/) (and the README, if relevant) for any
   user-facing change. To see what the suites cover, `make test-inventory` writes a
   generated (git-ignored) inventory you can read locally.

### File budget gate

The file-budget ratchet (issue #1105 Phase 0). A new tracked file has a hard ceiling of 800 lines, target
400; an existing offender's current line count is its personal ceiling in `docs/dev/file-budget.tsv`, and a
PR may not grow it past that — ceilings only ever move down, and the gate rejects a budget edit that raises
one.

A deliberate, justified addition to a budgeted file therefore has exactly one legal path: split or shrink
the file so the addition fits under a ceiling that stays put or drops — see issue #1258 for the worked
example, where a security test that outgrew its file moved into its own — and note that two same-wave merges
can each pass alone and fail together, so re-run `make lint` after merging onto the tip.

The ratchet half is fatal in CI when it cannot run at all: a job that resolves none of the base-ref
candidates has lost its `fetch-depth: 0`, which is a misconfigured job rather than a clean tree, so the gate
fails there instead of printing a note into a log nobody reads (issue #1739). A local checkout without those
refs still gets the note and still passes.

Generated code, vendored files, data/config, and prose docs are exempt by glob — see `is_exempt()` in the
script. The generated, git-ignored `pithead` is outside the tracked-file budget; the gate governs its
`lib/pithead/*.sh` sources.

One row was exempt from the ceilings-only-move-down half, and only that half: `lib/pithead/99-remainder.sh`
measured how much of that generated artifact Phase 2 had not split out yet, not the size of a file anyone
writes. Without that, the CLI could not gain a line, because the row refused to rise and the artifact grew
past it (issue #1464). That row has retired, and not by
reaching the 400 target: Phase 2 split the remainder out completely, so the file was deleted at 949 lines
and nothing in `docs/dev/file-budget.tsv` names it now. `monotonic_exempt()` in the script still carries the
arm and the reasoning behind it.

### One integration branch, and what that means for CI config

`develop` is the integration branch for everything the repo ships — the Docker Compose product and
the appliance OS tree under `os/` — and it is the repo's **default branch**. Until 2026-09-06 the
appliance lived on a twin branch, `develop-v2`; that branch was fast-forwarded into `develop` and
retired, so a reference to it anywhere in this tree is stale and should be fixed, not followed.

**Automation that GitHub reads from a fixed location must live on the default branch.** GitHub
fires a workflow's `schedule:` trigger from the default branch only, and Dependabot reads
`.github/dependabot.yml` from the default branch only. A scheduled workflow or a Dependabot entry
that lives anywhere else never runs — and a job that never runs looks exactly like a job that ran
and found nothing, which is why this went unnoticed three times while the twin existed
(#1146, #1162, #1163). Its sibling is #1048, worth knowing next to it: there the schedule did fire,
and the job skipped itself behind an unset repository variable, so `main` showed green for a gate
that had never run. Nothing in the tree needs an explicit checkout `ref:` or a Dependabot
`target-branch:` any more; if you find one, it is left over from the twin.

Check this from run history, never from the file — the file always looks fine:

```bash
gh run list --workflow=<name>.yml --limit 200 --json event \
  --jq '[.[].event] | group_by(.) | map({event: .[0], n: length})'
```

No `schedule` key in that breakdown means the schedule has never fired. A `schedule` key is
necessary but not sufficient — #1048's shape passes that test — so open the newest scheduled run and
check its steps actually ran rather than skipping:

```bash
gh run view <run-id> --json jobs \
  --jq '.jobs[].steps[] | "\(.conclusion)  \(.name)"'
```

The Dependabot equivalent of the first check is to group its PRs by `baseRefName`.

## Opening a pull request

- Target the `develop` branch and fill out the PR template.
- Link the issue your PR addresses (e.g. `Closes #123`).
- Make sure `make test` passes; CI runs the same checks.
- PRs require review before merging; reviewers are requested automatically via
  [CODEOWNERS](.github/CODEOWNERS).

## Style

- Match the surrounding code. Shell scripts should pass `shellcheck --severity=warning`;
  Python is linted and formatted by `ruff` (config in `dashboard/pyproject.toml`).
  Run `make lint-py`, or `cd dashboard && ruff format` to apply it.
- Keep commits tidy and messages descriptive.
