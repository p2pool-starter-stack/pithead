# The patch-coverage gate (#286), without the vacuous pass (#1000). diff-cover exits 0 with
# "No lines with coverage information" when the diff and coverage.xml don't overlap — which is
# fine for a shell/docs/compose-only PR but a silent hole when the diff changed measured
# dashboard Python that a stale coverage.xml never saw. This wrapper runs diff-cover, then
# checks that every changed file under the measured tree (dashboard/mining_dashboard/)
# appears in coverage.xml: absent files fail loudly, a diff with nothing measurable passes
# loudly and says so. Run `--self-test` to check the overlap logic against fixtures.

# of 2). Off a PR (a local run, or a push build) the base is `develop`, the one integration branch.
# `COMPARE` in the environment still wins, so a caller can grade against anything.

# slip through (catching those needs coverage's own statement analysis). The gate's contract is
# a fresh coverage.xml: run right after `make test-dashboard`, the order CI enforces.
