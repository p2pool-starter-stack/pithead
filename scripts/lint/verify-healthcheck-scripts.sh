# Every script-based healthcheck docker-compose.yml names must actually exist in the image its
# own service builds (#1098).
#
# #1098: the appliance shipped a docker-compose.yml (baked from the development tree, at whatever
# commit os/build-image.sh happened to run against) naming
# /usr/local/bin/xmrig-proxy-healthcheck.sh, while the images it pins (STACK_VERSION resolves to
# the last-released tag, not the tree's HEAD) predated the script — added together in one commit,
# #904, but read from two places that can fall out of step. The container reported unhealthy
# forever with nothing actually broken. Nothing caught it because nothing compared the two halves
# of that commit against each other again later, once time (and an unrelated VERSION bump cadence)
# had put daylight between them.
#
# This is the narrower, permanent half of the fix: docker-compose.yml and each first-party
# service's own Dockerfile are two files in the SAME tree, so whether the Dockerfile's build
# actually places a script at the path compose's healthcheck names is knowable by reading both —
# no docker build, no registry, no bench. Checked on every PR, it makes "the compose CMD outruns
# the Dockerfile COPY" a same-commit failure instead of a runtime-only, appliance-only symptom.
# It does NOT, by itself, catch the STACK_VERSION/release-cadence skew #1098 actually shipped with
# (that needs a real pulled image at the pinned tag, which this script never has) — see the
# xmrig-proxy healthcheck's own CMD-SHELL fallback (docker-compose.yml) for the remedy that does.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/lint/verify-healthcheck-scripts.sh              Check docker-compose.yml against the tree.
#                                                        rc 1 on any healthcheck script the
#                                                        matching Dockerfile never places there.
#   scripts/lint/verify-healthcheck-scripts.sh --self-test   Drive the parsers against fixtures,
#                                                        including the #1098 mutation. No docker.

# Every CMD/CMD-SHELL healthcheck naming a *.sh path, alongside the service's own build context —
# read straight off the raw compose YAML (no `docker compose config` needed: none of this is
# templated, so the file on disk already carries the literal answer). One "service|build-ctx|path"
# line per (service, script) pair; a CMD-SHELL fallback that mentions the same path twice (the
# xmrig-proxy remedy below) collapses to one line via sort -u by the caller.
#
# Deliberately line-oriented rather than a real YAML parse: `services:` entries sit at 2-space
# indent, their own keys at 4, `build:`'s own `context:` at 6 when it's a block — the same shape
# every service in this file already uses, so a state machine over those three indents is exact
# for this file without pulling in a YAML library.
#
# `test:` itself has TWO valid YAML spellings and this tree is not guaranteed to only ever use
# one of them: the flow sequence every current service happens to use (`test: ["CMD", "/p"]`),
# and the block-list form (`test:` on its own line, then `  - CMD` / `  - "/p"` beneath it) —
# equally valid YAML, equally something `docker compose config` accepts today. A parser that only
# recognises the flow form makes a block-list healthcheck silently INVISIBLE to this whole check:
# not a parse error, not a red — the service just never appears in the extraction, so a missing
# script under the block-list spelling passes as if nothing needed checking at all.
