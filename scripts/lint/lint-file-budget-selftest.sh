# git repo built for it. Split out of scripts/lint/lint-file-budget.sh for issue #1464: the gate was
# 407 lines at a recorded ceiling of 407, so it was closed to any addition, and the gate's own
# header rule says a file back under the 400 target must drop its budget entry. Splitting is
# therefore the remedy the gate itself documents, not a way around it.
#
# Run it directly, or as `scripts/lint/lint-file-budget.sh --self-test`, which execs this file.
# The gate is SOURCED for its functions, so it carries a guard that keeps sourcing from running
# anything; see the bottom of that script.
