# Shipped-image CVE sweep report (#1313).
#
# The Monday sweep in ci.yml rebuilds every image from the branch and scans the rebuild. That
# cannot answer the question users care about. A rebuild resolves apt at scan time, so it picks up
# archive fixes the published image never got — the sweep goes green while the bytes people are
# running still carry the CVE. It also scans the default branch, not the release. This report
# covers the other half: the images published at cut time, promoted by digest with no rebuild
# (release.sh stage 6 is `buildx imagetools create`, a re-tag), scanned exactly as published.
#
# REPORT-ONLY, and that posture is deliberate. A CVE in a shipped image is a fact to act on — it
# means "consider cutting a patch release", a decision a person makes — not a build to fail. The
# run goes red only when the sweep itself could not do its job.
#
# WHAT THIS SCRIPT IS. It does no scanning and touches no network. ci.yml's `sweep-shipped` matrix
# resolves each published tag to a digest, scans that digest with trivy, and uploads two files per
# image; this script reads that directory and renders the tracking-issue body. Keeping the render
# out of the workflow is what makes it testable — `--self-test` drives every failure mode below
# through fixtures with no docker, no network, and no GitHub.
#
# INCOMPLETE IS NEVER CLEAN. Every refusal below exits 1 and says UNCHECKED in the report rather
# than printing a reassuring zero. This is the defect class the whole currency lane exists for: a
# watcher with nothing to say and a watcher that has quietly died look identical from the Actions
# tab, and "0 findings" off a partial run is the most expensive kind of false green.
#
#   - the artifact directory is missing, or holds no scan output at all
#   - an expected image produced no report (its matrix leg failed)
#   - an unexpected image appeared (ci.yml's matrix and SWEPT_IMAGES below have drifted)
#   - a report cannot be parsed
#   - a report names an artifact that is NOT a digest reference, so the run cannot honestly claim
#     it scanned published bytes rather than a moving tag
#   - a report's artifact is a different image than the leg it arrived as
#   - the legs disagree about which release tag they swept (a cut landed mid-run)
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/watch/shipped-image-sweep-report.sh <dir>   Render the report for the artifacts in <dir> on
#                                                  stdout. rc 1 if the sweep was incomplete.
#   scripts/watch/shipped-image-sweep-report.sh --title  Print the tracking issue's title, nothing else.
#   scripts/watch/shipped-image-sweep-report.sh --self-test
#                                                  Drive the render + every refusal above through
#                                                  fixtures. No network, no docker, no gh.

# THE TITLE IS A CONSTANT AND MUST NEVER BE EDITED. The workflow upserts the tracking issue by
# EXACT title match over the open issue list. Change this string and the next run silently files a
# SECOND issue instead of updating the first, then keeps both — the old one frozen at whatever it
# last said, which reads as a sweep that found nothing new. Renaming the issue by hand in the web
# UI breaks it the same way.

# The images this report expects to find, which must match ci.yml's `sweep-shipped` matrix. The
# two lists are checked against each other at run time rather than trusted: a service added to the
# matrix and not here arrives as an unexpected file, one added here and not to the matrix arrives
# as a missing leg, and BOTH exit 1. A silently shrinking sweep is the failure this guards.

# Only fixable HIGH/CRITICAL are counted, the same scope ci.yml's gate uses (`ignore-unfixed`), and
# the same scope every `.trivyignore` entry is written against. It is also the only scope that maps
# to a decision: a patch release can only ship a fix that exists. Unfixed findings are left to the
# gate's own reporting rather than counted here as if someone could act on them. This is the label
# the table header prints; the jq filter below spells the same two out literally.
