# .trivyignore obsolete-mute watch (#1174).
#
# Nothing today checks whether a `.trivyignore` entry's finding still exists anywhere. Two
# sentences in the file itself used to claim the weekly CVE sweep (#833) does — it does not: the
# sweep passes `trivyignores: .trivyignore` to trivy (os-rootfs.yml, ci.yml), and trivy's ignore
# file filters matching findings OUT of the report before the sweep ever sees them. A muted finding
# is invisible to the sweep by construction, so a mute that outlives the finding it was written for
# rots silently — which is exactly how the two mutes #1153 found stale survived until someone
# checked by hand.
#
# REPORT-ONLY. The `pin-watch.sh` posture: never a gate, because a cleared mute is housekeeping, not
# a build failure. It never edits `.trivyignore` and never opens a PR.
#
# THE TRAP, found while writing #1174: `.trivyignore` is SHARED across both lanes and covers
# SEVERAL images. A per-image "does this ID still show up" check is worse than no check, because it
# produces a confident, WRONG deletion list — seven IDs looked dead scanning the appliance rootfs
# alone, and some of those were live dashboard-image mutes. An entry is obsolete only when it is
# absent from EVERY covered image's own scan, so this script builds and scans all of them with no
# ignore file and only reports an ID that no covered image reports.
#
# The covered images, enumerated from the real build/scan setup rather than guessed (ci.yml's
# build-images matrix + os-rootfs.yml, both cited below):
#   pithead-os-rootfs    os/rootfs/Dockerfile   (debian:trixie-slim + the golang builder stage)
#   pithead-dashboard    dashboard              (python:3.11-slim, the `production` stage — the
#                                                 same default target ci.yml's untargeted build uses)
#   pithead-monero       build/monero           (ubuntu:24.04)
#   pithead-p2pool       build/p2pool           (ubuntu:24.04)
#   pithead-xmrig-proxy  build/xmrig-proxy      (ubuntu:24.04)
#   pithead-tor          build/tor              (alpine:3.24)
#
# Each is built EXACTLY the way the gate builds it (same Dockerfile, same context, same required
# build args) — scanning an image built any other way proves nothing about what the gate sees.
#
# FAIL LOUDLY ON A BROKEN RUN. An empty image list, a build that cannot run, or a scan that cannot
# run (trivy/docker missing, a pull failure, an unparseable report) must never fall through to "0
# obsolete mutes found" — that is a false green wearing the report's own shape, the same defect
# class the sweep itself has. A broken or partial scan means "unknown", never "clean", so this
# refuses to name ANY mute obsolete off an incomplete run and exits 1 instead.
#
# THE PARITY CONTRACT (#1290). TRIVY_VERSION below is the one place that declares which trivy
# engine this script's own scan uses. `--check-parity` (wired into `make lint-trivy-parity`) holds
# ci.yml's and os-rootfs.yml's trivy-action `version:` input, and the pinned image's own measured
# version, to that one value — it does not prove what trivy-action resolves a declared input to at
# run time, only that the two workflows and this script all declare the same one; what the action
# does with a declared input is upstream's contract. A dependabot bump of trivy-action that silently
# moves the action's own UNDECLARED default is exactly the drift this catches.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/watch/trivyignore-watch.sh              Build + scan every covered image with NO ignore file
#                                              applied, print the report, rc 1 only if the run
#                                              itself is broken (an obsolete-mute finding is
#                                              printed, not a failure — report-only).
#   scripts/watch/trivyignore-watch.sh --self-test  Drive the union/report logic against fixture scan
#                                              output. No docker, no network, no image builds.
#   scripts/watch/trivyignore-watch.sh --check-parity
#                                              Check that ci.yml's and os-rootfs.yml's trivy-action
#                                              steps pin `version:` to TRIVY_VERSION (#1290). No
#                                              docker, no network. Exit code is the check's own rc.
