# Weekly upstream-currency watch (#1128).
#
# REPORTS ONLY. It never bumps a pin and never opens a PR. That is deliberate: a Tari or monerod
# minor is a data migration to schedule, not a bump to merge — #1129 carries three one-time
# migrations and a one-way wallet-DB change. RigForge's xmrig-bump.yml opens a build-verified PR
# instead, which is right there and wrong here; the two share this shape, not this output.
#
# The pins come from scripts/release/release.sh's pin(), which is where the release notes read them from.
# A second list is how the gap this closes opened in the first place.
#
# One question per component: is the pinned VERSION behind upstream's latest release?
#
# NOT asked here, deliberately: whether an image pinned `tag@sha256:...` still has a digest that
# corresponds to that tag. The digest is authoritative and the tag is decoration, so a bump that
# moves the tag and leaves the digest keeps running the old image while every doc says otherwise
# — but answering it needs a registry client (two different token flows for quay.io and Docker
# Hub), which is a second source type with its own failure mode. It is its own change.
#
# UNREACHABLE IS NOT CURRENT. Every failed lookup increments a counter, the run exits non-zero,
# and the report names what could not be checked. A watcher that has silently stopped otherwise
# looks exactly like a watcher with nothing to report — which is how a scheduled workflow in this
# repo ran zero times without anyone noticing.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/watch/pin-watch.sh              Print the markdown report on stdout; rc 1 if anything failed.
#   scripts/watch/pin-watch.sh --self-test  Drive the comparison logic against fixtures. No network.
