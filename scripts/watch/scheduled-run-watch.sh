#
# Scheduled-run watch (#1377).
#
# The Monday run of ci.yml IS the CVE sweep: `build-images` rebuilds every image and scans the
# rebuild (#833), `sweep-shipped` scans the published digests (#1313). A scheduled run has no pull
# request, so nothing draws a person to it — and on 2026-08-17 `build-images` went red and nobody
# was told for seven days. This watcher is that run's reader.
#
# WHY IT IS NOT A JOB INSIDE ci.yml. Two reasons, both measured rather than assumed:
#
#   1. SUBJECT. The one reader ci.yml already has is `sweep-shipped-report`, and its tracking issue
#      is titled "Shipped-image CVE sweep" — a title that is also the upsert key, so it cannot be
#      widened without orphaning the existing issue and filing a duplicate on the next run. Filing
#      a `build-images` red under it would put a finding about a REBUILD of the branch inside the
#      one report whose whole premise is that it scanned the bytes users pulled, and would make its
#      "Last fully successful sweep" stamp span two different questions.
#   2. IT GENERALISES. `build-images` is the job that reddened, but it is not the only job that can.
#      Watching the RUN covers every job the schedule reaches, including ones added later — the
#      failure mode of a per-job reader is that it silently stops covering the thing it was named
#      for.
#
# REPORT-ONLY, like its two siblings. A failed sweep is reported into a tracking issue rather than
# reddening this run, because "the Monday sweep found a CVE" asks for a decision a person makes,
# and because reddening a scheduled run is precisely the notification that was proven not to work.
# This run goes red only when the WATCHER could not do its job.
#
# WHAT THIS SCRIPT IS. It does no lookups and touches no network. The workflow calls `gh` and
# leaves two JSON files in a directory; this script reads them and renders the tracking-issue body.
# Keeping the render out of the workflow is what makes it testable: `--self-test` drives the clean
# path and every refusal below through fixtures, with no network and no gh. That matters more here
# than usual, because the red path CANNOT be exercised live — staging it would mean making the
# default branch's CI genuinely fail.
#
# INCOMPLETE IS NEVER CLEAN. Every refusal below exits 1 and says UNCHECKED rather than printing a
# reassuring "no failures". A watcher with nothing to say and a watcher that has quietly died look
# identical from the Actions tab.
#
#   - the directory is missing, or holds no runs file
#   - the runs file cannot be parsed, or lists no scheduled run at all
#   - the newest scheduled run has not finished, so nothing can be said about whether it passed
#   - the newest scheduled run failed and its jobs file is missing, unparseable, or names no job
#
# NOT COVERED, deliberately, and filed as #1418: a scheduled run that never HAPPENS. This watcher
# reads the runs it can see, so a dropped cron is invisible to it in exactly the way it is
# invisible to everything else. The history table below is the human-readable half of that — a
# reader can see the gap — but nothing here decides that a gap is too long.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/watch/scheduled-run-watch.sh <dir>    Render the report for the JSON in <dir> on stdout.
#                                           <dir>/runs.json  = gh run list --json ... (an array)
#                                           <dir>/jobs.json  = gh run view --json jobs (an object)
#                                           rc 1 if the watch could not do its job.
#   scripts/watch/scheduled-run-watch.sh --title  Print the tracking issue's title, nothing else.
#   scripts/watch/scheduled-run-watch.sh --self-test
#                                           Drive the render and every refusal above through
#                                           fixtures. No network, no gh.

# THE TITLE IS A CONSTANT AND MUST NEVER BE EDITED. The workflow upserts the tracking issue by
# EXACT title match over the open issue list. Change this string and the next run silently files a
# SECOND issue instead of updating the first, then keeps both — the old one frozen at whatever it
# last said, which reads as a watch that found nothing new. Renaming the issue by hand in the web
# UI breaks it the same way.
