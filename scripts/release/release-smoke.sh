# Post-publish release smoke test (#459) — run ONCE, right after `make release` publishes vX.Y.Z.
#
# The tier-4 matrix tests a branch; it cannot test a PUBLISHED, SIGNED artifact that only exists
# after publish. Two things need that artifact for an honest check — the #376 cosign verification and
# the #59 one-click upgrade — so they are verified here, gated behind the publish, not in CI (before
# this existed they were hand-checked on the release checklist). Reuses scripts/release/release.sh for the
# image list / registry / naming, so there is one source of truth for what a release contains.
#
# Phase 1 (always): download the published pithead.tar.gz (+ .sig) and the 5 :vX.Y.Z images and
#   cosign-verify them FOR REAL against the committed cosign.pub — not the pre-merge fake cosign.
#     - a good signature passes;
#     - a byte-changed bundle is refused (this is what proves the verify is real);
#     - the bundle's own VERSION equals the tag (the #376 rollback guard — an older signed bundle
#       served at the vX.Y.Z URL is caught);
#     - every published image verifies, and an unrelated key is refused.
#   If the release is UNSIGNED (every release before v1.18.1, or a --unsigned cut) that is reported
#   plainly — never a false
#   pass. Runnable from any box with `gh` auth + network; needs no deployed stack.
#
# Phase 2 (--upgrade DIR): drive the REAL #59 host path against a previous-release install — enqueue
#   the exact upgrade intent the dashboard writes into its control spool, run the host control runner,
#   and assert the install upgrades cleanly to the published tag over the same download → verify →
#   rollback-guard → extract → `pithead upgrade` path. DESTRUCTIVE to that box's stack: run it on the
#   previous-release bench box (the stack must be up with dashboard.control enabled), never on the
#   release host.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/release/release-smoke.sh [vX.Y.Z] [--upgrade DIR] [--keep] [-h]
#     (no version → the tag derived from the VERSION file)
#
# Environment:
#   PITHEAD_REGISTRY / PITHEAD_IMAGE_PREFIX   Override the image namespace (same as release.sh).
