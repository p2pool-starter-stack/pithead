# Third-party image pin currency, at the digest level (#1137).
#
# pin-watch.sh asks "is the pinned VERSION behind upstream's latest release" and says outright that
# it does NOT ask whether a pinned `tag@sha256:...` still has a digest that matches its tag. This
# script asks exactly that second question, for every third-party image docker-compose.yml pins by
# digest: quay.io/tarilabs' tari node and wallet, tecnativa's socket-proxy, and caddy.
#
# The digest is what actually runs. A version bump that moves a tag and leaves the digest behind
# still runs the OLD image while the pin, the release notes, and every doc claim the new one — the
# exact half-done bump #1137 is about. Comparing tags (what pin-watch.sh already does) cannot catch
# it; only asking the registry what a tag resolves to right now can.
#
# Pin source is one grep over docker-compose.yml, not a hand-kept list: first-party images use
# ${PITHEAD_REGISTRY...}/${STACK_VERSION...} and are never digest-pinned, so the `@sha256:` pattern
# alone is the whole filter. A new third-party pin lands here on the next run with no edit to this
# file, and a first-party image added the same way is never mistaken for one.
#
# UNREACHABLE IS NOT CURRENT. A registry lookup that cannot complete is counted, named, and rc 1 —
# never silently treated as a match. A pin that could not be checked is UNCHECKED, not current.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/release/resolve-pins.sh              Compare every digest-pinned image against its registry.
#                                         rc 1 on any mismatch OR any failed lookup.
#   scripts/release/resolve-pins.sh --self-test  Drive extraction + comparison against fixtures, docker
#                                         stubbed as a shell function. No network.
