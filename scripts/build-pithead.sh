# Build the `pithead` CLI from its sources in lib/pithead/ (#1105 Phase 2).
#
# Release bundles and appliance images carry the single generated file, so the split into sources
# cannot introduce a runtime `source`. Build by concatenating lib/pithead/*.sh in LC_ALL=C name
# order, byte for byte, under a banner naming this script as the generator. The output is ignored
# by git and rebuilt by make, release.sh, and os/build-image.sh where it is consumed.

# Concatenation order is the whole contract: the artifact's ordering constraints (`set -Eeuo
# pipefail` before any code, `on_err` defined before `trap on_err ERR`, the `_STACK_SOURCED`
# guard, `cd "$SCRIPT_DIR"`, `main "$@"` last) are preserved by keeping the slices in file order
# and naming them so that order is their sort order. Hence the numeric prefixes. `validate_ordering`
# below checks two of those invariants mechanically rather than trusting the numbering (#1463): a
# name `readonly` in two slices, and a bare `trap` target defined later than where it is installed.

# Join the slices with ONE blank line between each pair, and refuse the ways this can silently
# produce nonsense.
#
# The blank line is the build's job, not a slice's, and that is forced rather than chosen. `shfmt`
# strips blank lines from both ends of a file, and it reaches these slices through `make lint-sh`'s
# `git ls-files '*.sh'` glob — so a slice cannot carry the separator at either edge and stay
# format-clean. Since the artifact separates its top-level blocks with exactly one blank line
# anyway, joining on one puts the separator where both tools agree: every slice is independently
# shfmt-clean, and cutting a new slice at any blank line between two top-level blocks reproduces
# the artifact byte for byte. A boundary at two blank lines or none is refused on the spot.
#
# Refusals, each guarding a way the build could look like it worked:
#   - an empty enumeration (a moved or mistyped source dir builds an empty "artifact"; every later
#     slice-move would then read as a catastrophic diff rather than as a missing directory)
#   - a first slice without the shebang (whatever sorts first carries it; if it does not, sort
#     order and file order have come apart and the artifact would not be executable)
#   - a slice with a blank first or last line, which is the separator rule above being broken —
#     caught here by name rather than as a malformed generated file
#   - an entry that is not a regular file (a directory named `*.sh` matches the glob). This one
#     fails closed either way, so it is about the REASON given: checked before the shebang test,
#     because `head` on a directory reads as a missing shebang and sends the reader hunting a
#     sort-order bug that does not exist
#   - an EMPTY slice, named as empty rather than as "opens with a blank line", which is what the
#     leading-edge check alone would have called it
#   - a slice with no trailing newline. This one is the least obvious and the most dangerous: the
#     blank-line checks above use `tail -n 1`, which returns the last line's CONTENT for a file
#     that simply stops without a newline, so neither of them fires. The join then runs that
#     slice's last line straight into the next slice's first with NO separator at all — and once
#     that state is generated into a broken script.
# Cross-slice semantic ordering (#1463): concatenation preserves BYTE order (proven above, and by
# the byte checks), but nothing before this proved it preserves the ordering INVARIANTS the header
# above names. Two shapes reproduce faithfully from source to artifact and shellcheck is silent at
# both `--severity=warning` and `-S info`, but they break when the artifact RUNS:
#
#   - the same `readonly` name declared in two slices (a line copied to both sides of a boundary
#     instead of moved, e.g. two adjacent slices each declaring `readonly FOO="bar"`): a second
#     `readonly` on an already-readonly name is a fatal bash error the instant the artifact runs
#     ("FOO: readonly variable"), invisible to any check that never runs it.
#   - a bare `trap NAME SIG` installed before NAME is defined (a re-cut that leaves the trap's own
#     target sorting into a later slice): shellcheck resolves a direct call ahead of its
#     definition (SC2218 "This function is only defined later") but treats a trap target as an
#     opaque string, so the identical ordering mistake routed through `trap` is invisible to it at
#     any severity.
#
# Caught here by one forward scan over the slices IN BUILD ORDER, tracking every readonly name
# declared OUTSIDE a function body (at any indentation — `00-prelude.sh` declares one inside an
# `if`) and every top-level function name as each is DEFINED: a re-declared readonly name, or a
# bare trap target not yet in that set, refuses the build with the offending file:line. "Readonly"
# is by spelling, not by the bare word: `readonly NAME`, `readonly -a NAME=(…)`, `declare -r` and
# `typeset -r` all declare one, so leading flags are stripped before the name is recorded rather
# than letting a flag-carrying line drop out of the net silently. A bare trap is one identifier
# followed by any number of signal specs, so `trap f EXIT INT` is seen too. A `readonly` inside a
# function body is skipped: `local x; readonly x=…` in two functions is two independent names, not
# a collision, and recording it refused a build that runs fine. Function bodies are delimited the
# way shfmt writes them — `name() {` at column 0 opens one, `}` at column 0 closes it, and a
# `name() { …; }` one-liner opens nothing. A bare `readonly`/`declare -r` inside a function is
# global unless paired with `local`; this simple scope scan skips that latent shape. Scoped to
# top-level slice order deliberately, matching
# what the build script's own header promises — it does not attempt general control-flow analysis
# (a function only ever called from inside a conditional that happens not to run first is out of
# scope, same as it is for shellcheck).
