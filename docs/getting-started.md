# Getting Started

Install and first-run setup, from a fresh Ubuntu host to a synced, mining stack. The `pithead`
script drives every step.

This is the DIY path: your host, your OS. To dedicate a machine and skip the host management
entirely, write [the appliance image](appliance.md) to a USB stick instead — same stack, same
dashboard, no Linux to set up.

> ```bash
> curl -fsSL https://github.com/p2pool-starter-stack/pithead/releases/latest/download/pithead.tar.gz | tar xz
> cd pithead
> cp config.minimal.json config.json   # set your Monero + Tari payout addresses
> ./pithead setup
> ```

> Let it run, then open the dashboard at `https://<your-hostname>`.

## 1. Prerequisites

| Requirement | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| Operating system | Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS is the supported platform. Other Linux distributions may work but aren't supported. macOS is deprecated as of 2026-09-10 and is not tested; the installer refuses it. |
| CPU | A processor with AVX2 support for RandomX performance. |
| RAM | 16 GB minimum with HugePages enabled (~6 GB is reserved for RandomX); 32 GB for a full node or long uptimes. |
| Disk | A pruned Monero node needs ~100 GB and a full one ~270 GB, plus ~150 GB for the Tari node (its chain is the biggest single consumer). Plan for ~330 GB (pruned) or ~530 GB (full) of SSD minimum. Both chains grow ~100+ GB/year, so a 2–4 TB drive is the set-and-forget choice. Running either node on another machine drops its share — see [Running a node elsewhere](hardware.md#running-a-node-elsewhere). |
| Software | Docker Engine, Docker Compose V2, `jq`, and `openssl`. |

> 📐 Sizing guidance for the stack host — minimum vs. recommended specs, plus ways to run leaner —
> is in **[Hardware Requirements](hardware.md)**. Miner specs live in
> [RigForge](https://github.com/p2pool-starter-stack/rigforge).

> 🔎 `setup` checks this for you. Before it starts anything, `./pithead setup` runs a best-effort
> pre-flight on free disk and total RAM. If either is below the recommended minimums (~330 GB
> pruned / ~530 GB full disk, 16 GB RAM), it prints a warning. The disk figure follows the node
> modes you configured; the 16 GB RAM warning fires regardless. It never blocks setup, so you can
> proceed on a smaller host at your own risk. See **[Hardware Requirements](hardware.md)**.

You don't have to install the software dependencies yourself. `setup` checks for them and, on
Ubuntu, offers to install anything missing. To do it manually:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y jq docker.io docker-compose-v2 openssl
```

On an unsupported OS, or if dependency detection misfires on an unusual setup, run setup with
`--skip-deps` to bypass the check entirely.

## 2. Get the code

Download the latest release. This pulls the published, tested images (no local build), so the
dashboard shows the real version and the update-checker works:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/p2pool-starter-stack/pithead/releases/latest/download/pithead.tar.gz | tar xz
cd pithead
cp config.minimal.json config.json   # then set your Monero + Tari payout addresses
```

`config.minimal.json` is minimal: just your two payout addresses. `setup` fills in defaults for
everything else. For the full set of knobs, copy `config.reference.json` instead. Have your
Monero and Tari payout addresses ready (Tari wallets are sometimes labeled Minotari, same thing).

### Alternative: build from source

To build the images locally instead of pulling the published ones, e.g. to develop or modify the
stack, clone the repo. pithead sees the `build/` context and builds locally, tagging the images `:dev`
(the dashboard badge then reads `dev · <branch> @ <commit>` instead of the release version):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/p2pool-starter-stack/pithead.git
cd pithead && make
cp config.minimal.json config.json   # then set your payout addresses
```

Release archives already include the generated `pithead` executable. Git clones keep only its
numbered sources, so `make` builds the executable before the first `./pithead` command.

> Changed your mind later? You can convert a clone to the published images in place. See
> [Switching a source checkout to release images](operations.md#switching-a-source-checkout-to-release-images).

## 3. Run setup

```bash
./pithead setup
```

Setup walks through five stages. It's interactive on the first run and safe to re-run later.

1. **Dependency check.** Verifies Docker, Docker Compose, `jq`, and `openssl` are present. On
   Ubuntu it offers to `apt install` anything missing; on other systems it tells you what to
   install. Skip with `--skip-deps`.

2. **Interactive configuration.** Asks only what only you can answer, in two short stages, then
   fills in the rest and writes a minimal `config.json`, locked down to owner-only (`chmod 600`).
   - **Required:** your Monero and Tari wallet addresses; whether you're running a local Monero
     node (the default — the stack runs its own) or connecting to a remote one, with a local
     node's RPC credentials auto-generated; and your P2Pool pool tier (`main`/`mini`/`nano` —
     pick low if you're not sure, a high-hashrate default silently starves a small rig of
     shares). An optional dashboard login, Enter to skip.
     The wizard asks about the Monero node only. To merge-mine against a Tari node on another
     machine, set `tari.mode: remote` and `tari.remote.host` in `config.json` afterwards and run
     `./pithead apply` — see [Remote Tari node](configuration.md#remote-tari-node).
   - Once the config is written, setup asks one more thing: the hostname you'll use to reach the
     dashboard in a browser. Enter accepts this machine's hostname.
   - **A few more, Enter for the default:** a faster clearnet initial sync instead of the private
     Tor default; reaching the dashboard from outside your LAN over Tor; Telegram alerts; and
     whether this machine should also mine with its spare CPU (a co-located RigForge worker).
   - Everything else — ports, XvB tuning, energy pricing, per-worker overrides, and more — keeps
     its documented default; the wizard prints a pointer to `config.json` and
     [Configuration](configuration.md) at the end for anyone who wants it.

3. **Tor provisioning.** Brings up the Tor service and waits for the hidden-service (onion)
   addresses: P2Pool always, plus Monero and Tari for whichever of those nodes runs locally. A node
   in remote mode gets no inbound onion — it accepts its own peers where it runs.

4. **Kernel optimization (Linux only).** Configures HugePages for RandomX performance. Making
   HugePages persistent edits GRUB and requires a reboot. You're prompted before any GRUB change,
   and you can skip this whole stage with `--skip-optimize`.

5. **Start.** Once everything is provisioned, setup offers to start the stack.

> If you enabled persistent HugePages, reboot before mining. After the reboot, start the stack
> with `./pithead up`.

### Setup flags

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--skip-optimize` | Skip the kernel/GRUB HugePages tuning (useful on non-Linux hosts or when you tune the kernel yourself). |
| `--skip-deps` | Skip dependency detection and installation. |

## 4. First boot: the node syncs

This section assumes both nodes run here, the default. A chain served from another machine
(`monero.mode` / `tari.mode: remote`) never syncs on this host — its container isn't started at all.

The first time the stack starts, your Monero and Tari nodes download and verify the blockchain
from the network. Until both are fully synced, the dashboard shows a dedicated Sync Mode screen
with live progress for each chain, and no hashrate is routed yet. When the stack first comes up,
`pithead` prints a short "what happens next" note saying the miner is held until both chains sync,
then starts automatically — it shows once, not on every restart.

This can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more depending on your hardware, disk, and
network. Watch progress on the dashboard, with `./pithead status` (it prints each chain's percent
and blocks remaining while syncing), or in the logs:

```bash
./pithead logs monerod
./pithead logs tari
```

Each line applies only to a node this host actually runs — in remote mode that service isn't in the
stack, so `logs` has nothing to follow.

Once both chains report fully synced, the dashboard switches from Sync Mode to the full
operational view and the stack begins mining. See [The Dashboard](dashboard.md) for a tour of
both states.

> Already have a synced Monero node? You can skip most of the initial sync by pointing the stack
> at your existing blockchain data, or by connecting to a remote node. See
> [Reusing an existing node](configuration.md#reusing-an-existing-node). The same holds for Tari:
> point `tari.data_dir` at an existing Minotari chain, or set `tari.mode: remote` to merge-mine
> against a node on another machine — see [Remote Tari node](configuration.md#remote-tari-node).

> Sync crawling over Tor? The default routes the first sync over Tor for privacy, which is slow.
> You can opt into a faster clearnet initial sync for Monero and/or Tari; each node switches back
> to Tor automatically once it's synced. It's default-off and privacy-relevant, so read the
> trade-off first:
> [Optional clearnet initial sync](privacy.md#optional-clearnet-initial-sync-off-by-default).

## 5. Open the dashboard

The dashboard is served over HTTPS by Caddy:

```
https://<your-hostname>
```

`<your-hostname>` is the host you set during setup (the script prints the exact URL when it
starts the stack). Caddy uses a self-signed certificate (`tls internal`), so the first time you
visit, your browser shows a one-time "your connection is not private" / untrusted-certificate
warning. Accept it to continue. Prefer plain HTTP on your LAN? Set `dashboard.secure: false` in
`config.json` and run `./pithead apply`.

---

## 6. Connect your miners

Point your XMRig miners at the stack machine on port `3333`. That's the single endpoint for all
your rigs. Do not put your wallet address in the miner config; the stack handles payouts
centrally.

See [Connecting Miners](workers.md) to point an existing rig at the stack, or use
[RigForge](https://github.com/p2pool-starter-stack/rigforge) to provision a tuned miner from scratch
in one command.
