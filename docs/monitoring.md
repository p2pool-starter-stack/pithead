# Monitoring & alerting

Pithead can ping an external **dead-man's switch** so you find out when your mining host
goes down — even when it can't tell you itself. It also serves a
[Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint](#prometheus-metrics) for operators who run their own
monitoring stack.

## Why an *external* monitor?

If the stack hits a problem while the machine is still alive — a node falls out of sync, a
container crashes — it can notice and react locally. But the failures that hurt most are the
ones that kill the whole host: **power loss, a kernel panic, a dead NIC, the box hanging**. A
dead machine can't send its own "I'm down" alert.

[Healthchecks.io](https://healthchecks.io) solves this by inverting the logic. The stack
periodically pings a unique URL; **Healthchecks.io alerts you when the pings *stop***. Because
the alert is evaluated on Healthchecks.io's servers, it survives the very outage you want to
catch. It's a *dead-man's switch*: silence is the alarm.

This is **off until you configure it** and entirely optional — with no ping URL set, nothing
pings and nothing is logged.

---

## Setup (about 5 minutes)

### 1. Create a check on Healthchecks.io

1. Sign up at [healthchecks.io](https://healthchecks.io) — the **free tier** (20 checks, 3
   months of history) is plenty for one stack. (Prefer to self-host? See
   [Self-hosting](#self-hosting-your-own-instance) below.)
2. Create a new check. Name it something like `pithead`.
3. Set its schedule. The recommended values, which match Pithead's fixed 60-second ping interval:
   - **Period — 1 minute.** How often Healthchecks.io *expects* a ping. The stack pings once a
     minute, so a 1-minute period tracks it closely.
   - **Grace — 5 minutes.** How long after a missed period before you're alerted. This slack
     absorbs a brief blip — e.g. a quick dashboard-container restart — without a false alarm,
     so you're only alerted after roughly **6 minutes** of true silence. Shorten it for faster
     alerts (more false positives on blips), lengthen it to tolerate longer restarts.
4. Copy the check's **ping URL** — it looks like `https://hc-ping.com/<uuid>`.

### 2. Choose where alerts go

On the check's **Integrations** tab, point it at however you want to be notified — **email**,
**Telegram**, Slack, Discord, a webhook, and more. If you already run the [Telegram
bot](telegram.md), route Healthchecks.io to the **same** Telegram group, so host-down alerts and
in-stack events land in one place — step-by-step in
[Telegram › Adding Healthchecks.io to the same group](telegram.md#adding-healthchecksio-to-the-same-group).

### 3. Paste the ping URL into `config.json`

Add a `healthchecks` block with your ping URL — that URL is the on switch (see
[`config.reference.json`](../config.reference.json)):

```json
{
    "healthchecks": {
        "ping_url": "https://hc-ping.com/your-unique-uuid-here"
    }
}
```

`ping_url` is the only key — an `http://` or `https://` URL turns the monitor on, blank keeps it
off. A value with any other scheme is treated as unset: nothing pings, and nothing is logged.

### 4. Apply

```bash
./pithead apply
```

`apply` previews the change and recreates the dashboard container. The ping URL is treated as
a secret — it's stored in the owner-only `.env`, never echoed by `apply`, and never logged.

That's it. Within a cycle or two the check on Healthchecks.io turns green. Kill the stack (or
the whole host) and, once the period + grace elapses, Healthchecks.io alerts you.

---

## How it works

- The dashboard's existing data-collection loop sends the ping each cycle, so it reuses the
  process that's already running — no extra container or daemon. If the host dies, the
  dashboard dies with it, the pings stop, and the alert fires. If only the dashboard container
  restarts briefly, the **grace period** absorbs the gap.
- **Liveness only — is the *stack* up.** This is a pure dead-man's switch: it reports that the
  dashboard loop (and therefore the host) is alive, nothing more. It deliberately does **not** try
  to say whether a node is synced or a miner is connected. In-stack health — monerod or Tari down
  while the box is still running — is reported by the [Telegram alerter](https://github.com/p2pool-starter-stack/pithead/issues/121)
  (#121), which can send a specific, actionable message a single red check can't. Two tools, two
  jobs: Healthchecks answers "did the whole thing die?", Telegram answers "what's wrong inside it?".
- **Always over Tor.** The ping goes through the stack's [Tor](architecture.md) SOCKS proxy, so the
  endpoint only ever sees a Tor exit, not your host IP — it's never a clearnet beacon. This means
  your ping URL must be reachable over Tor (hosted `hc-ping.com` is; a self-hosted instance must be
  public or an onion service — a LAN-only address won't work). See the [Privacy note](#privacy-note).
- **Fails quietly, rejects loudly.** A ping that can't get out — you're offline, or Tor is
  momentarily down — is logged at debug level only; Healthchecks.io alerts on the missed ping
  regardless, which is the point. A ping the endpoint *answers* with a non-2xx status is different:
  a revoked or mistyped URL logs `Healthchecks ping rejected: HTTP <code>` once, on the transition.

---

## Configuration

There's a single key: **`healthchecks.ping_url`** — set it to turn the monitor on, leave it blank
to keep it off. The stack then pings that URL over Tor every 60 seconds. Full reference (with the
secret-handling and Tor-reachability notes): [Configuration › reference](configuration.md#configuration-reference).

> Auto-provisioning the check via the Healthchecks.io Management API (so you wouldn't have to
> copy the URL by hand) was considered but deliberately left out: it would mean storing a
> high-privilege API key in your config. Manual setup keeps it simple, secret-free, and works
> equally well with a self-hosted instance.

---

## Self-hosting your own instance

Healthchecks is open source and [self-hostable](https://healthchecks.io/docs/self_hosted/). To
point Pithead at your own instance, just paste its full ping URL into `ping_url` — it already
carries your host, so nothing else is needed:

```json
{
    "healthchecks": {
        "ping_url": "https://hc.example.com/ping/your-unique-uuid-here"
    }
}
```

Because the ping **always goes over Tor**, your instance must be reachable that way: expose it as
an **onion service** (best for privacy — the ping stays on Tor end to end) or on a public URL. A
LAN-only address (e.g. `http://192.168.1.10/...`) won't work — Tor can't route to private addresses.

---

## Privacy note

The ping is **always routed over Tor**, reusing the same bridge Tor SOCKS proxy as the XvB fetch —
so the endpoint sees a **Tor exit**, not your host's IP, and the DNS lookup goes through Tor too
(`socks5h`). There is no clearnet mode; the dead-man's switch is never an IP beacon.

Two things to know:

- **Tor is part of the ping path.** If the Tor container is down while the host is up, the ping
  can't get out and the check will eventually alert — a *false* "host down". The 5-minute grace
  absorbs brief Tor blips, and pings retry every cycle, so only a sustained Tor outage trips it.
  That's usually what you want (Tor down *is* a problem worth knowing about). One such outage is
  Tor stuck on a **failing guard** — bootstrapped, mining fine, but clearnet exits dead (#424):
  `./pithead doctor` diagnoses it, `./pithead restart tor` fixes it, and `tor.auto_heal: true`
  automates the fix. See
  [Operations › Troubleshooting](operations.md#troubleshooting).
- **Your ping URL must be Tor-reachable.** Hosted `hc-ping.com` is. A self-hosted instance must be
  public or, better, an **onion service** — paste its `.onion` URL and the ping stays on Tor end to
  end with no exit node in the middle. A LAN-only address won't work (Tor can't route to it).

---

## Optional: a host-level ping, independent of the dashboard

Pinging from the dashboard loop covers the big failure modes (host death, dashboard crash). If
you want a liveness signal that doesn't depend on the dashboard at all — handy on a dedicated
mining box — add a small **systemd timer** on the host that curls the same (or a second) ping
URL:

```ini
# /etc/systemd/system/pithead-heartbeat.service
[Unit]
Description=Ping Healthchecks.io (host heartbeat)
[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/usr/bin/curl -fsS -m 10 --retry 3 https://hc-ping.com/your-unique-uuid-here
```

```ini
# /etc/systemd/system/pithead-heartbeat.timer
[Unit]
Description=Run the Healthchecks.io heartbeat every minute
[Timer]
OnBootSec=1min
OnUnitActiveSec=1min
[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
```

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now pithead-heartbeat.timer
```

Use a **separate** check for the host timer if you want to tell "the host is up" apart from
"the mining stack is up."

---

## Verifying & troubleshooting

- **The check never goes green.** Confirm `ping_url` is set and you ran `./pithead apply`, then
  check the dashboard logs (`./pithead logs dashboard`) for a `Healthchecks.io dead-man's switch
  enabled` line at startup — if it's absent, no ping URL is configured. The ping is always over
  Tor, so a URL your Tor exit can't reach (e.g. a LAN-only self-hosted instance) will never land;
  unreachable-endpoint failures are logged at debug level only. A URL the endpoint *rejects* logs
  `Healthchecks ping rejected: HTTP <code>` once — grep the dashboard log for it before assuming
  the ping is landing.
- **Test it end to end.** Stop the stack (`./pithead down`) and wait for the period + grace to
  elapse — you should get the alert. Start it again and the check recovers. `./pithead test-alert`
  deliberately excludes Healthchecks because sending a ping would move the dead-man switch.
- **Too many false alarms.** Increase the **period** and/or **grace** on Healthchecks.io.

## Prometheus metrics

The dashboard exposes its live operational figures in Prometheus text format at `/metrics` —
hashrate averages, worker counts, PPLNS shares, luck and expected time-to-share, the trailing-1h
reject rate, node sync/health, XvB state, disk usage, and database health as gauges named
`pithead_*`, plus three counters: cumulative accepted shares (`pithead_shares_accepted_total`),
rejected shares (`pithead_shares_rejected_total`), and pool blocks found
(`pithead_pool_blocks_found_total`). `pithead_snapshot_age_seconds` reports how old the data
loop's snapshot is — alert on it growing past a few update intervals to catch a wedged loop
that would otherwise keep scraping as healthy. The reject-rate gauge is omitted while no shares
were submitted in the window (no shares is not 0% rejected). The endpoint renders the same
metrics snapshot the dashboard UI uses; it is always on and needs no configuration.

`/metrics` is served on the same routes as the dashboard itself: Caddy fronts it on the
dashboard port, and when a dashboard password is set (`dashboard.auth.password`, see
[Configuration](configuration.md)), the scrape needs the same credentials. A minimal
`scrape_configs` entry:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: pithead
    metrics_path: /metrics
    scheme: https
    tls_config:
      insecure_skip_verify: true   # the stack's certificate is self-signed
    basic_auth:                    # only when dashboard.auth.password is set
      username: admin
      password: <your dashboard password>
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["<host>"]
```

The exposed values are current only — no history; the dashboard's own database keeps the
persisted series. Scraping over Tor from outside the LAN (e.g. via the
[onion service](configuration.md#remote-access-over-tor-onion-service)) is out of scope here;
scrape from the same network.
