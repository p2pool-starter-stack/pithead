# The Release / Validation Server

How a build is validated end-to-end before release, why that needs a dedicated server, what
GitHub Actions runs on every PR, and how to harden the server. Operational companion to
[Releasing](releasing.md) (the version/promote pipeline) and
[Integration Testing](integration-testing.md) (the harness it runs).

## Can GitHub Actions do the full end-to-end? (no)

GitHub-hosted runners can't do the real-chain tier. On a public repo the hosted Ubuntu runners
are free (4 vCPU / 16 GiB RAM), but they are ephemeral: a fresh VM per job, ~14 GiB of free
disk, and a 6-hour job ceiling. A pruned Monero chain measures ~258 GiB on our own bench
([#1446](https://github.com/p2pool-starter-stack/pithead/issues/1446)) and an unpruned one is
larger still [TODO: verify upstream — no full-chain measurement exists on this bench]; either
takes days to sync, and Tari adds ~50 GiB. There is nowhere to keep that synced state between runs, and no time
to sync it inside a job. So the real-daemon, real merge-mining tier (tier 4) is not possible on
hosted runners. That's the reason a dedicated, already-synced server exists
([#54](https://github.com/p2pool-starter-stack/pithead/issues/54)).

GitHub already runs almost everything else, free, on every PR. Tiers 1–3 of the
[testing strategy](testing-strategy.md) need no real chain and run on the hosted runners in
minutes:

- Tier 1, unit/component (dashboard pytest + coverage gate, frontend, the `pithead` shell
  suite, compose interpolation, and the #90 security/hardening invariants).
- Tier 2, contract (the real Monero/Tari clients vs. controllable fakes).
- Tier 3, the fake-daemon mini-stack (the real dashboard + docker-control proxy driven against
  fake daemons, with real Docker on the hosted runner). This proves the control plane
  end-to-end (sync hold/release, reject/readmit) on every PR.

So the split is clean:

| | Runs | Cost | Triggered |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Tiers 1–3** (logic, wiring, control plane, hardening) | GitHub-hosted runners | free (public repo) | every PR, the merge gate |
| **Tier 4** (real synced Monero+Tari, real merge-mining, prune/full DB, TLS/Tor, the config matrix, the staging smoke test) | the dedicated server | your hardware | pre-release / on-demand, the release gate |

The hosted runners catch most regressions before merge. The dedicated server proves what only
real chains can, and it is the blocking pre-release gate.

## Validating PRs on the dedicated server (possible, but security-loaded)

You can register the server as a GitHub Actions self-hosted runner so Actions dispatches the
tier-4 job to it (self-hosted minutes don't count against anything, also free). But there is a
sharp edge, and it's the single most important thing on this page:

> NOTE: GitHub explicitly recommends against self-hosted runners on public repositories. Any
> user can open a pull request, and a malicious PR can run arbitrary code on the runner. The
> server holds real wallet payout addresses, Tor onion private keys, and RPC credentials, so a
> compromised runner is a key-theft / persistent-backdoor event, not a flaky build.

The safe rule: the keyed server only ever runs code you trust. Concretely:

- Do not trigger tier-4 on `pull_request` (and never on a fork PR). "Require approval" only
  gates starting the run; once it starts, the PR's code still executes on the box.
- Configure a protected `release-server` environment with required maintainers. The workflow
  must also restrict deployment branches to the protected default branch: that platform check runs
  before a branch-supplied job can reach the runner. The workflow additionally fails non-default
  dispatches and checks out the dispatch's immutable SHA, but that in-workflow check is only
  defense in depth and is not a trust boundary. Without the environment deployment-branch rule,
  the workflow is unsafe and must not be dispatched. Stage candidate release artifacts
  separately. Run a pre-merge exact-head gate from the operator shell under the hardware claim/lock
  protocol, never by executing a PR's workflow on this keyed runner.
- Set the repository variable `RELEASE_GATE_ACTORS` to a comma-separated maintainer allowlist;
  both the original dispatch actor and any rerun actor must be listed.
  Provision `/etc/pithead-release/cosign.pub` as a root-owned, non-symlink copy of the reviewed
  repository key; the workflow refuses any other trust-root path or content.
- Register the runner as ephemeral / just-in-time (one job, then auto-removed) in its own runner
  group, isolated from any private repos.
- Keep the runner least-privilege: a dedicated unprivileged user, the box runs nothing else
  sensitive, and ideally the runner reaches the stack only through `pithead`/`docker`, not the
  raw key files.

This is how the workflow ships.
[`.github/workflows/release-gate.yml`](../../.github/workflows/release-gate.yml) runs only on
`workflow_dispatch`, behind the protected `release-server` environment on a
`[self-hosted, pithead-release]` runner. It fails a non-default ref and checks out the immutable
default-branch dispatch SHA, verifies the actor allowlist and fixed root-owned release key, and
never accepts a candidate branch or later-moving branch tip. It never runs automatically on a PR
or push; a trigger that arrives before its runner is
how `main` ends up wearing a gate that never ran (#1048). Since releases fast-forward `main`
at publish time, a `push` trigger would also fire *after* the release it was meant to gate —
any future automation belongs on the ref being cut, not on `main`.

## Provisioning the server

Target an LTS Ubuntu (22.04 / 24.04). One-time:

1. Install Pithead and let it fully sync ([Getting Started](../getting-started.md)): full Monero +
   full Tari, all containers healthy, a worker (ideally two) mining. The synced
   `monero.data_dir` / `tari.data_dir` are the asset the harness reuses.
2. Keep the active chain on fast storage (SSD/NVMe). monerod is random-I/O heavy, so the chain
   it runs against must not sit on a spinning HDD; that alone makes every scenario crawl. A
   snapshot/reflink-capable filesystem (btrfs/zfs/xfs reflink) is a bonus: it lets the harness
   snapshot/restore a chain cheaply for the prune axis. It's optional. On plain ext4-on-SSD the
   matrix only edits `config.json` and reuses one chain, with `--safety-backup` isolating
   destructive runs. See the recipe below for the prune-axis details.
3. Disk headroom: enough for the chains plus a snapshot / second DB (budget ≥ ~150 GiB free
   beyond the live chains).
4. Tools: `jq`, `curl`, `docker` (compose v2), `sha256sum`, `git`, `tar`.

Check the box is fit at any time, non-destructively:

```bash
tests/integration/run.sh --host you@server --dir pithead --readiness
```

It asserts: chains synced (reusable), the prune axis is exercisable (the live chain FS is
snapshot-capable **or** a pre-built variant chain is supplied), disk headroom, `.env` is
owner-only, the dashboard is bound to localhost, and the backup/rollback net is usable.

### The lint/release toolchain

`make release`'s blocking test gate runs `make lint`, which shells out to `shellcheck`, `shfmt`,
`node`/`npx`, and `uv`/`uvx`. A reimaged box loses these, so the release preflight
([#426](https://github.com/p2pool-starter-stack/pithead/issues/426)) stops early and names the
missing tool rather than dying mid-gate. Restore them with the same pinned versions CI uses
([`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](../../.github/workflows/ci.yml)) — apt's `shellcheck`/`shfmt` are older
and reformat differently, so a version skew would fail `make lint` on the box for diffs the merge
gate never saw. Both pins live in the `Makefile` — `SHELLCHECK_VERSION` and `SHFMT_VERSION` — and
each is what `ci.yml` installs and what `make lint-sh` refuses to run without;
`make -s print-shellcheck-version` and `make -s print-shfmt-version` print them, and the block below
calls those commands rather than copying what they print, so it cannot go stale against the pins.
One wrinkle worth knowing when you check by hand: `shfmt --version` prints a leading `v` on the
upstream release builds while some distro builds print a bare number, so the gate strips it before
comparing.

```bash
# node 20 (brings npx) + the basics the harness also needs
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs jq curl git tar make

# shellcheck + shfmt, read from the Makefile pins instead of copied. This block reads the repo, so
# it needs a checkout and runs from its root. If it does not, the two guards name that as the cause.
# Run as a script they also stop it; pasted into an interactive shell they do not, so what follows
# is a 404 you can interpret rather than one you cannot.
SC=$(make -s print-shellcheck-version)
SF=$(make -s print-shfmt-version)
: "${SC:?not in a checkout - run this block from the repo root}"
: "${SF:?not in a checkout - run this block from the repo root}"
curl -fsSL "https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/releases/download/v$SC/shellcheck-v$SC.linux.x86_64.tar.xz" | tar -xJ -C /tmp
sudo install -m 0755 "/tmp/shellcheck-v$SC/shellcheck" /usr/local/bin/shellcheck
sudo curl -fsSL -o /usr/local/bin/shfmt "https://github.com/mvdan/sh/releases/download/v$SF/shfmt_v${SF}_linux_amd64"
sudo chmod 0755 /usr/local/bin/shfmt

# uv 0.10.10 (pinned installer; brings uvx, and adds ~/.local/bin to PATH)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/0.10.10/install.sh | sh
```

### The release signing key

The pipeline signs every promoted image digest and the install bundle with cosign
([#376](https://github.com/p2pool-starter-stack/pithead/issues/376), key-based — see
[Releasing › Signed releases](releasing.md#signed-releases) for what installs verify and how).
The private key lives only on this box, like the GHCR token; the public key is committed in the
repo as `cosign.pub`. The release preflight refuses to run without cosign, `COSIGN_KEY`,
`COSIGN_PASSWORD`, and `cosign.pub` all in place — signing is mandatory to publish because it is
mandatory to consume ([#960](https://github.com/p2pool-starter-stack/pithead/issues/960)), so a
missing piece aborts the cut rather than warning past it. `--dry-run` reaches the same decision and
skips only the signing, so a rehearsal on this box tells you whether the real cut would sign.

Preflight then proves the key end to end: it signs a probe blob and verifies it through the same
digest-pinned cosign container installs use. A `cosign.pub` that is no longer the public half of
`COSIGN_KEY` fails here rather than in the field
([#1084](https://github.com/p2pool-starter-stack/pithead/issues/1084)).

Install cosign (pinned — there is no Ubuntu apt package; the same snippet works on any host that
wants to verify). Take **v2.6.3**, not the newest: cosign v3 removed the `--tlog-upload` flag both
signing calls pass, and a drifted box would otherwise pass every other check and die at the signing
stage with the images already promoted. Preflight probes for the flag and aborts early if it is
gone.

```bash
curl -fsSL -o /tmp/cosign https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/releases/download/v2.6.3/cosign-linux-amd64
echo '7c78a7f2efc00088bd788a758db6e0928e79f3e0eb83eb5d3c499ed98da4c4f4  /tmp/cosign' | sha256sum -c
sudo install -m 0755 /tmp/cosign /usr/local/bin/cosign
```

Generate the key pair once, on this box:

```bash
cosign generate-key-pair      # prompts for a passphrase; writes cosign.key + cosign.pub
mkdir -p ~/.config/pithead-release
mv cosign.key ~/.config/pithead-release/cosign.key
chmod 600 ~/.config/pithead-release/cosign.key
```

Commit the `cosign.pub` it wrote at the repo root (it is the only half that ever enters the
repo), and point the release shell at the private half:

```bash
export COSIGN_KEY=~/.config/pithead-release/cosign.key
read -rs COSIGN_PASSWORD && export COSIGN_PASSWORD   # typed, not in shell history
```

Both are also defaults now: the preflight falls back to
`~/.config/pithead-release/cosign.key` when `COSIGN_KEY` is unset, and reads
`~/.config/pithead-release/cosign.passphrase` (a `chmod 600` file) when `COSIGN_PASSWORD` is
unset — so a cut on this box needs no signing exports at all. The passphrase file is optional:
delete it to be prompted per cut via the `read -rs` line above.

cosign reads `COSIGN_PASSWORD` from the environment to decrypt the key; neither the key nor the
passphrase ever appears on a command line, in the repo, in an image, or in the release log. Keep
an offline backup of `cosign.key` with the passphrase stored separately — losing it means
rotating the key. To rotate: generate a new pair the same way, commit the new `cosign.pub`, and
cut a transition release **signed with the old key** (leave `COSIGN_KEY` on the old key for that
one cut) — installs verify the bundle with the key they already hold and come out holding the new
one; switch `COSIGN_KEY` to the new key for the next release. If the old key is lost or
compromised, sign with the new key immediately: the transition release then fails the bundle
check on existing installs, so call it out in the release notes and have operators verify that
one by hand against the new committed key.

### The RAUC update-signing key

cosign signs the GHCR image digests and the install bundle. The **appliance** takes a second,
independent signature: every A/B update bundle (`os/rauc/mkbundle.sh` → `*.raucb`) is signed, and
RAUC on the device refuses any bundle that does not verify against the keyring baked into the
running slot (`os/rauc/system.conf` → `[keyring] path=/etc/rauc/keyring.pem`). This key is the
appliance fleet's update trust root: whoever holds it can push a bundle every fielded box will
install as authentic. Treat it exactly as you treat `cosign.key`.

The tooling refuses to invent one. `mkimage.sh` / `mkbundle.sh` auto-generate a throwaway
`CN=pithead-dev` key only for a build explicitly marked `--dev`; a release build (no `--dev`) exits
non-zero unless the key is named:

- `PITHEAD_RAUC_KEY` / `PITHEAD_RAUC_CERT` — the leaf that signs the bundle (private key + its
  cert/chain).
- `PITHEAD_RAUC_KEYRING` — the cert(s) baked into every slot as the device trust anchor. Defaults
  to `PITHEAD_RAUC_CERT`; for the root+leaf model below, set it to the **root** so a leaf can be
  rotated without re-imaging.

So a dev cert can never silently become a shipped keyring — the guard, not memory of this page, is
what enforces it.

**Trust model: root + leaf, only the root baked.** Use a two-cert chain, not one self-signed cert
doing both jobs. A single self-signed cert used as both trust anchor and signer is the shape the
bake-off found stricter verifiers reject (`CaUsedAsEndEntity`), and it couples the two rotations
that should be independent: the root that every device trusts is baked into the image and cannot
change without re-imaging, while the leaf that signs day-to-day should be cheap to replace. Bake
the **root** as the keyring; sign bundles with a **leaf** issued from it. RAUC verifies the bundle's
leaf against the baked root, so a leaf reissued from the same root is trusted by every fielded box
with no image change.

Generate the pair once, on this box (RSA-4096 mirrors the dev chain; the root is a CA, the leaf is
a `digitalSignature` end entity):

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/pithead-release && cd ~/.config/pithead-release

# Root — the device trust anchor. Baked into every slot; its private key is used ONLY to issue
# leaves, so keep it offline and out of the release shell's environment.
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout rauc-root.key -out rauc-root.pem \
    -days 3650 -subj "/CN=pithead-update-root" \
    -addext "basicConstraints=critical,CA:TRUE"        # prompts for a passphrase

# Leaf — the day-to-day signer, issued from the root.
openssl req -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -keyout rauc-signer.key -out rauc-signer.csr \
    -subj "/CN=pithead-update-signer"
openssl x509 -req -in rauc-signer.csr -CA rauc-root.pem -CAkey rauc-root.key \
    -CAcreateserial -out rauc-signer.pem -days 825 \
    -extfile <(printf 'basicConstraints=critical,CA:FALSE\nkeyUsage=critical,digitalSignature\n')

chmod 600 rauc-root.key rauc-signer.key
chmod 700 ~/.config/pithead-release
```

**Storage.** The root private key (`rauc-root.key`) is the crown jewel: keep it offline (an
encrypted volume or a hardware token), passphrase-protected, and off this box between rotations —
it is needed only to mint a new leaf, never to cut a routine release. The leaf key
(`rauc-signer.key`) lives on this box like `cosign.key`, `chmod 600`, owner-only, with an offline
backup. Only the certs (`rauc-root.pem`, the leaf `.pem`) are ever safe to hand out; neither
private key enters the repo, an image, or a log. Point the release shell at the release material:

```bash
export PITHEAD_RAUC_KEYRING=~/.config/pithead-release/rauc-root.pem     # baked as the device keyring
export PITHEAD_RAUC_CERT=~/.config/pithead-release/rauc-signer.pem      # leaf that signs the bundle
export PITHEAD_RAUC_KEY=~/.config/pithead-release/rauc-signer.key
```

`mkimage.sh` bakes the keyring cert into slot A; `mkbundle.sh` signs the bundle with the leaf. Both
refuse to run for a release with these unset — there is no silent fallback to a dev cert.

**Rotation.** The constraint that shapes the whole runbook: **RAUC trusts the keyring baked at
image build time, so a device only ever trusts what shipped in its running slot.** A new trust
anchor therefore has to reach devices *inside an OS update they already trust*, before any bundle
is signed under it — a keyring is not something a device can be told to add out of band.

- *Routine, or a leaf compromise (root intact).* Issue a fresh leaf from the same root (the second
  `openssl` pair above), and sign with it. Every fielded box already trusts the root, so nothing
  needs re-imaging. This is the case root+leaf exists for, and it should be the only one you ever
  hit in practice.
- *Root rotation (planned key change, or a suspected root compromise you can still sign around).*
  You cannot swap the anchor in one step. Build a **transition OS update** whose baked keyring
  contains **both** the old and new roots (concatenate the PEMs), and sign that bundle with a leaf
  under the **old** root so existing boxes accept it:

  ```bash
  cat rauc-root.pem rauc-root-new.pem > rauc-keyring-transition.pem
  PITHEAD_RAUC_KEYRING=~/.config/pithead-release/rauc-keyring-transition.pem \
    PITHEAD_RAUC_CERT=~/.config/pithead-release/rauc-signer.pem \
    PITHEAD_RAUC_KEY=~/.config/pithead-release/rauc-signer.key \
    ...build image + bundle...
  ```

  Ship it and wait for the fleet to take it. Only once a box is running that slot does its keyring
  trust the new root; from then on you may sign with a leaf under the new root. A later update can
  bake the new root alone and drop the old one. Sequencing is everything — sign under the new root
  before the fleet has taken the transition update and those boxes reject the bundle.
- *Root lost or compromised beyond signing (you can no longer produce a bundle the fleet trusts).*
  There is no remote recovery, the same dead end as a lost `cosign.key`: fielded devices trust only
  the baked root, so a bundle signed by anything else is refused. Recovery is a hands-on re-image
  of each box with a fresh keyring. Call it out in the release notes and, as with cosign, have
  operators verify the first post-incident image by hand against the new published root.

The dev/bench loop is unchanged — `os/rauc/mkimage.sh --dev` still auto-generates a throwaway into
the gitignored `os/rauc/certs/` and needs none of the above.

### Recipe: prune-axis coverage, and the storage that matters

Put the active chain on fast storage. The biggest factor is the disk, not the filesystem:
monerod does heavy random LMDB I/O, so a chain on a 7200 rpm HDD makes every scenario crawl.
Check what you have before placing chains:

```bash
lsblk -d -o NAME,ROTA,SIZE,MODEL   # ROTA=0 is SSD/NVMe, ROTA=1 is a spinning HDD
```

Keep the chain monerod runs against on an SSD/NVMe. A spare HDD is fine for cold backups and
`pithead backup` archives, but not for an active test chain.

A CoW filesystem (btrfs/zfs/xfs-reflink) is a bonus, not a requirement. On a CoW volume the
harness can snapshot/restore a chain cheaply for per-scenario isolation, but only if it's on
fast storage. A loopback btrfs on a spare HDD gives you CoW semantics at HDD speed, which is the
wrong trade for an active chain. If your root FS is ext4 on an SSD (the common case) you don't
need CoW at all: the matrix only edits `config.json` and reuses one chain, and `--safety-backup`
(a `pithead backup` + auto-rollback) isolates the destructive scenarios.

Covering both prune modes. The box mines one mode (its real config). The harness exercises that
mode against the live chain and skips the other unless you supply a chain for it
(`--full-data-dir` / `--pruned-data-dir`). You usually don't need to: the opposite mode is
covered by the fake mini-stack ([integration-testing](integration-testing.md)) plus the
compose/config tests, which need no real chain. Supply the opposite-mode chain only to exercise
it end-to-end, and build it on fast storage:

- Pruned chain next to a full one? [`build-pruned-chain.sh`](../../tests/integration/tools/build-pruned-chain.sh)
  copies the LMDB consistently (brief monerod stop, then immediate restart) and prunes the copy,
  leaving the canonical chain untouched. Fetch `monero-blockchain-prune` at the same version as
  the running monerod and verify it against the hash the image pins (`build/monero/Dockerfile`
  → `MONERO_VERSION` / `MONERO_HASH`).
- Full chain? Pruning is irreversible, so a full chain means a fresh full sync
  (`MONERO_PRUNE=0`, ~1–3 days), rarely worth it just for test coverage.

The reference box is a pruned node on NVMe: it validates pruned mode live with `--safety-backup`,
and full mode comes from the fakes. `--readiness` reports exactly this:

```bash
tests/integration/run.sh --host you@server --dir pithead --readiness
```

## Bench allocation and the rig lock

The bench boxes are shared between this repo's tier-4 harness, RigForge's release gates, and
production mining. Two automations cycling the same rig's services corrupt each other's results
(a real 2026-07 incident: an operator "fixed" a service an e2e run had deliberately stopped),
so ownership is static and every run takes a kernel lock.

Static allocation — each box states its owner in `/etc/bench-role`, and each box's own
`~/README.md` carries its specifics (hostname, role, data roots):

| Box role | Owner | Use |
|---|---|---|
| RigForge bench rig | RigForge | `e2e-real` / tune gates. Pithead never touches its services. |
| Loaner rigs (two) | Pithead | Tier-4: `e2e.sh` repoints one at the test bench for a run, then reverts it. Verify `systemctl is-active xmrig` after any remote restart. |
| Fleet rigs | Production | Mining only. No test traffic. |
| Test bench | Pithead | Test bench + release box (the tier-4 target). |
| Production host | Production | Production stack; deploys only. |

The run lock — **RESERVE**. Both harnesses take a `flock` on `/var/lock/rig-e2e.lock` before
the first service-touching action and hold it on an inherited FD for the whole run, so the
kernel releases it the moment the run dies — `kill -9` included, no stale-lock cleanup.
rigforge#183 defines the mechanism;
[#430](https://github.com/p2pool-starter-stack/pithead/issues/430) is this repo's mirror; the
shared path on every box is the protocol. Mutating runs hold it exclusive; read-only runs
(`run.sh --check` / `--readiness`) hold it shared, so concurrent readers coexist but still
exclude mutators. `tests/integration/run.sh` takes it on the target box (over SSH for `--host`);
`e2e.sh` also takes it on the loaner rig it borrows. A busy box makes the run exit 75
(`EX_TEMPFAIL`) naming the holder; set `RIG_LOCK_WAIT=1` to queue instead. `/run/rig-e2e.holder`
is a display-only sidecar naming the holder — the flock is authoritative, and a stale sidecar
is harmless.

**CHECK** — and **FREE**, which is not a step for anyone. A harness frees the lock by dying:
it holds it on an inherited descriptor, so the kernel drops it when the run ends, however it
ends, and a holder that has to remember to free is a holder that eventually does not. An off-box
actor (a human or an agent over SSH) never holds it at all — the command below is a probe.
`true` returns at once and the lock goes with the ssh session, so it reports that the box was
free at that instant and nothing more. For however long the work then takes, the actor is
unprotected and a harness run can take the lock underneath it:

```bash
ssh <box> 'flock -n -x /var/lock/rig-e2e.lock true' || ssh <box> 'cat /run/rig-e2e.holder'
ssh <box> 'cat /etc/bench-role'   # the box's static owner
```

## Hardening checklist (the pitfalls)

Treat the box as production-sensitive. It holds keys and it's the thing that signs off releases.

- Secrets. `.env` (RPC creds), `config.json` (wallet addresses), and the Tor data dir (onion
  private keys) must be owner-only (`chmod 600 .env`; the `--readiness` check verifies this).
  Never print secrets in logs; the harness hashes them on the box and redacts artifacts. If the
  box also publishes releases, the GHCR token lives in the environment / a secret store, never in
  the repo — and so do the release signing keys: `cosign.key` + `COSIGN_PASSWORD`
  ([#376](https://github.com/p2pool-starter-stack/pithead/issues/376)), and the RAUC update leaf
  key (`rauc-signer.key`) with the RAUC root key kept offline entirely — all owner-only on this
  box, only their certs/public halves ever committed or handed out (see the signing-key sections
  above).
- Network. Firewall to least exposure: inbound SSH (key-only, no root login, fail2ban) and the
  stratum port scoped to the LAN ([workers › firewall](../workers.md#firewall)); the dashboard
  stays on localhost behind Caddy and the monerod RPC on localhost (both asserted by
  `--readiness`). Nothing else should be reachable from the internet.
- Untrusted code. The runner only runs trusted code (see above). Prefer ephemeral/JIT runners;
  don't share the runner with private repos.
- Least privilege. A dedicated unprivileged user; the stack already runs least-privilege
  containers (`no-new-privileges`, `cap_drop`, read-only roots, scoped Docker socket proxies,
  regression-guarded in `tests/stack/standalone/test_compose.sh`).
- Reproducible, clean baseline. The matrix reuses the synced read/write chains, which may advance
  normally; it does not replace them during config-only cases. The image-upgrade gate takes
  private reflink snapshots of every writable mount and restores them, restores the
  original `config.json` at the end, and `--safety-backup` takes a `pithead backup` first and
  rolls the box back (down → restore → up) if anything fails.
- Build isolation and integrity. Build images in containers with pinned upstream versions and
  SHA256-verified binaries (the stack already does this). The gate authenticates its private
  candidate archive and image digests; later publication preserves those image digests but creates
  a separate release bundle ([Releasing](releasing.md)).

## How a release is validated end-to-end

1. Every PR → GitHub-hosted runners run tiers 1–3 (the merge gate). Cheap, free, fast.
2. Pre-release → tiers 1–3 run in normal CI. A maintainer separately dispatches the protected
   release-gate workflow: every mode runs readiness and `--check`; `matrix`, `xvb`, and `combined`
   opt into their named destructive legs. Candidate production/signing remains an external private
   prerequisite. Per [Releasing](releasing.md), the later staging smoke pulls promoted-by-digest
   images and verifies labels/platforms; a functional staged-tag run is opt-in via
   `RELEASE_SMOKE_CMD`.
3. Nothing is tagged or published until that's green, and promotion is by digest, so the version
   users get is the exact bundle the server validated.

## End-to-end coverage & gaps

What the live tier-4 gate exercises, and what it doesn't, so a release decision is made with eyes
open. (The reference box is a pruned Monero node on NVMe; its own snapshot and this table also
live at `~/pithead-testbench/` on the box, for operators and AI agents.)

Historical live coverage (not current exact-head release evidence): the config matrix (remote/local node, dashboard
secure/insecure, Tari required/optional, RPC LAN access, XvB on/off) applied + asserted; lifecycle
(restart, secret-preserving `apply`, backup→restore round-trip); node-down failover → recovery;
release readiness; pruned monerod (the real prod config); and recorded no-clearnet evidence during
the Tor-down fault and recovery path from [#274](https://github.com/p2pool-starter-stack/pithead/issues/274).
The sustained IPv4 TCP bridge-container observation and running XvB-over-Tor configuration assertion from
[#206](https://github.com/p2pool-starter-stack/pithead/issues/206) exist in `run.sh`; this change
fixes the branch e2e precheck so `--check` actually runs them after readiness. Their first exact-head
record is still pending. Covered without a real chain (tiers
1–3): client↔daemon contract tests, the fake-daemon mini-stack (incl. full-prune behavior),
compose hardening, config rendering, dashboard tests.

| Gap (not tested live) | Worth filling before release? |
|---|---|
| Full (unpruned) Monero live, which a pruned box can't exercise | Low. Stack paths don't differ by prune mode; fakes/config cover it. A multi-day full sync isn't justified. |
| Protected pre-release gate: the self-hosted runner is manual/opt-in | Medium-high, high-value. Keep `workflow_dispatch` restricted to the protected default branch and approved actors; it is not a required PR check. |
| Exact-head steady-state privacy, cross-version upgrade, and XvB route record | Medium. Run `--check`, then the opt-in combined gate on the reserved bench. Upgrade requires private CoW snapshots and proves authenticated manifest/image identity, mounts, captured chain anchors, durable state, secrets, workers/mining, derived state, and old-baseline restoration. The steady-state observation covers active bridge-app IPv4 TCP; it does not attribute the host-network dashboard or capture UDP. The focused candidate-client fetch is kernel-isolated with only Tor as a peer, and the enabled route starts only with hooked DROP rules. No recent share fails the requested XvB gate. |
| Multi-worker scale: the harness assumes ~2 workers | Medium. Add a load-gen worker + assert proxy routing/hashrate for perf confidence. |
| Real Tari merge-mined block acceptance | Low. Probabilistic; rely on template/connectivity checks. |
| Fault injection over SSH: no recorded live evidence | Low-Medium. The faults already use the shared SSH/local target wrapper; [#2000](https://github.com/p2pool-starter-stack/pithead/issues/2000) tracks the focused remote quoting, cleanup, and restoration proof. |

Recommended before release: record the new combined upgrade/XvB run and wire the protected
self-hosted gate when a runner exists. The remaining rows are explicit residual gaps.
