# Benchmark: mining over Tor vs clearnet (#256)

This document records a benchmark of mining-path yield over Tor versus clearnet: what we measured, from
where, and how we decided.

> **Status: complete (2026-06-22).** Routing p2pool over Tor costs **≈10 % of mining yield**
> on `mini`. The cost is propagation latency (uncle/late shares), not rejects, and **Tor stays the
> default**. Full per-arm results and the committed raw data are in [Results](#results). The methodology
> and decision rule below were fixed **before** the run (pre-registration); the run executed on the
> [test bench](../../tests/integration/tools/testbench-README.md).

## The question

While the stack is actively mining at steady state, does routing the mining-path networking
over Tor instead of clearnet measurably cost yield or reliability? This gates the Tor-by-default
decision for two paths:

- p2pool outbound sidechain P2P ([#165](https://github.com/p2pool-starter-stack/pithead/issues/165)) — `p2pool.clearnet` knob.
- XvB donation mining ([#166](https://github.com/p2pool-starter-stack/pithead/issues/166)) — `xvb.tor` knob.

This is not about initial sync over Tor. That is a separate, already-settled question
([#183](https://github.com/p2pool-starter-stack/pithead/issues/183)/#234: Tor IBD is impractically
slow, hence the opt-in clearnet-then-Tor initial sync). Here both monerod and Tari stay on Tor
throughout; only the p2pool / XvB egress changes between arms.

## What we measure, and from where

Every source below was verified against the live p2pool container on the test bench (`/stats/*` files written
by p2pool's `--local-api` / `--data-api`, plus the dashboard `/api/state` and `docker stats`).

### Primary — yield (the bottom line)

"Does Tor cost us money" is captured directly by our share of the PPLNS reward window. No raw orphan
counter is required: an orphaned/uncled share fails to earn its full weight, which shows up here.

| Metric | Meaning | Source · field |
|---|---|---|
| **PPLNS reward share** | our % of the sidechain reward window — direct revenue | `/stats/local/stratum` · `block_reward_share_percent` |
| **Yield efficiency** | reward-share ÷ hashrate-share; `< 1` ⇒ shares going stale | derived: `block_reward_share_percent` ÷ ( `hashrate_1h` ÷ `/stats/pool/stats` · `pool_statistics.hashRate` ) |
| **Effort** | hashes-per-share vs expected — rises when shares are found but not counted | `/stats/local/stratum` · `average_effort`, `current_effort` |
| **Uncle / orphan events** (our shares) | raw stale-share count — a mechanism cross-check on the yield number | parse the p2pool **console log** (`SHARE FOUND` + `SideChain` uncle markers); **not** in `/api/state` |

> **Why reward-share is primary, not a raw orphan count.** p2pool includes uncle shares at reduced
> weight and drops orphans entirely; both effects land in `block_reward_share_percent`, so the net
> revenue impact is measurable from the stratum stats today. The raw uncle count (log-parse) is kept
> as a secondary cross-check, not the decision metric. It is noisier and harder to attribute to *our*
> shares.

### Secondary — the mechanism (latency / connectivity)

These explain why the yield moved, or confirm it didn't. All are available today.

| Metric | Source · field |
|---|---|
| Share-found cadence / time-to-first-share | `/stats/local/stratum` · `shares_found`, `last_share_found_time` |
| Sidechain peer count & churn | `/stats/local/p2p` · `connections`, `incoming_connections`, `peer_list_size` |
| Stratum-level rejects | `/stats/local/stratum` · `shares_failed` |
| Effective hashrate on pool | `/stats/local/stratum` · `hashrate_1h`, `hashrate_24h` |
| Tor daemon overhead under sustained traffic | `docker stats tor` (CPU %, mem) |

### XvB donation path (#166)

> **Not collected in the headline run.** XvB is disabled so the p2pool-yield comparison isn't
> confounded (see *Method* below). These fields apply only to a separate, dedicated XvB-transport
> measurement, where they'd be sampled during donation windows (when `algo_service` has routed the
> proxy to XvB).

| Metric | Source · field |
|---|---|
| Accepted / rejected / invalid shares to XvB | xmrig-proxy `/summary` → `/api/state` · `proxy_summary.{accepted,rejected,invalid}` |
| Credited raffle weight | XvB stats API (already fetched over Tor, #163) · `block_reward_share_percent` analogue at XvB |

## Method

- **Rig:** the test bench (running `develop`) plus the **full RigForge fleet (8 miners,
  ~269 kH/s combined)** at a **fixed hashrate**, all pointed at the bench's stratum. A constant total
  hashrate across both arms is load-bearing for the ratio metric below.
- **Sidechain: `mini`.** At ~269 kH/s we are **~1.8 % of the `mini` sidechain** (observed ~14.75 MH/s),
  or **~155 of our own shares/day**. That gives enough statistical power while staying a small,
  representative participant. (`main` at this hashrate yields only ~10 shares/day, too sparse. `nano`
  would make us **~11 % of the chain**, large enough that our own latency would drag it and overstate the
  Tor penalty. The uncle/orphan rate is set by the ~10 s share interval, the same on every sidechain,
  so the `mini` result generalises to `main`/`nano`.)
- **Design — INTERLEAVED A/B** (not one long block per arm): alternate **T → C → T → C** in fixed
  **20 h blocks** so each arm samples the same diurnal / weekly / network-weather range. (A "5 days Tor
  then 5 days clearnet" layout would confound the arm with the calendar period.) **Discard the first
  3 h after each switch** while p2pool reconnects and the PPLNS window re-stabilises. As run: **6 blocks,
  3 per arm, over ~5 days**, yielding ~270–290 of our shares per arm. That is below the ideal ≥500, a
  deliberately shortened schedule, which is why the result is reported as "roughly 10 %"
  rather than a tight point estimate (see the confidence note in [Results](#results)).
  - **Arm T (Tor):** `p2pool.clearnet=false` (`--socks5`), `tor_egress_firewall=true`, `xvb.tor=true` —
    the `develop` defaults (fail-closed, egress-gated).
  - **Arm C (clearnet):** `p2pool.clearnet=true`, `tor_egress_firewall=false`, `xvb.tor=false`. The
    **firewall must be off in this arm.** The #270 Tor-egress firewall DROPs direct clearnet dials, so
    leaving it on would give p2pool 0 sidechain peers and the arm would silently collect garbage. The
    arm switch toggles the two together. monerod + Tari keep their Tor app-config in both arms, so only
    p2pool's transport differs; clearnet exposure here is the intended baseline on the test bench.
  - Only the **mining-path transport** flips. Held constant in both arms: monerod + Tari on Tor,
    **XvB disabled** (`xvb.enabled=false`, see below), the rig, hashrate, sidechain, and monerod tip.
  - **Why XvB is disabled for this run.** With `XVB_DONATION_LEVEL=auto` the optimizer dynamically
    splits the fleet between p2pool and XvB to climb raffle tiers. On the test bench it routed ~96 kH/s
    to XvB vs only ~18 kH/s to p2pool while chasing the **Whale** tier. That (a) starves p2pool, so
    `reward_share`, our **primary** metric, would be measured on a fraction of the fleet, and (b)
    makes the split itself a function of Tor latency, i.e. the optimizer reacts to the very thing we're
    trying to isolate. Disabling XvB sends the **full ~269 kH/s to p2pool in both arms**, so
    `reward_share` is a clean readout of transport overhead (and ~155 shares/day, not a trickle). The
    XvB **transport** overhead (#166) is a separate, smaller question, benchmarked on its own, not
    folded into the p2pool-yield comparison. The harness re-asserts `xvb.enabled=false` on every
    `pithead apply` so a switch or recovery can't let the optimizer drift back on.
  - Every switch is **egress-gated** by `bench-verify-egress.sh`. Arm T must be a clean all-Tor PASS
    before any data is collected, so a leak can never silently invalidate a window.
- **Controlling natural variance:** (1) **interleave** (the dominant control); (2) compare the
  **ratio** yield-efficiency = reward-share ÷ hashrate-share, which cancels out the sidechain's total
  hashrate drifting as other miners come and go; (3) run to a **target share count**, not a fixed
  clock, so Poisson noise (~1/√N) sits below the effect we're resolving; (4) the **clearnet arm's
  block-to-block variance is the noise floor** for the decision; (5) hold everything else constant.
- **Collector:** [`bench-collect.sh`](../../tests/integration/benchmarks/bench-collect.sh), a
  read-only poller that snapshots the `/stats/*` fields plus `docker stats tor` into one JSONL line per
  interval (default 5 min), per arm, in `~/pithead-bench/<arm>.jsonl`. No new container.

## Running it — autonomous on the test bench

The run must survive the operator being offline for days, so **everything runs on the test bench**; a
laptop / SSH session is only an optional observer. Three layers:

- **[`bench-orchestrate.sh`](../../tests/integration/benchmarks/bench-orchestrate.sh)** (detached on
  the bench) drives the whole run: flips the arm each block via `pithead apply`, egress-gates the switch,
  (re)starts the collector, health-checks every cycle, writes `~/pithead-bench/status.json`, and
  **self-protects**. Transient blips (a miner reconnecting, Tor circuit churn) are tolerated and
  recorded, but a genuine *unrecoverable* break **pauses collection and marks that window invalid**
  rather than polluting the dataset. An unwatched multi-day break then costs calendar time, not data.
- **Cron watchdog** (`*/15 * * * *` plus an `@reboot` entry) runs
  [`bench-healthcheck.sh`](../../tests/integration/benchmarks/bench-healthcheck.sh): restarts the
  orchestrator or collector if either died, re-`up`s the stack if it's down, appends `health.log`.
  This catches the orchestrator itself dying or a bench reboot, which the orchestrator can't
  self-report. Runs as the operator user; the only privileged step (`iptables`) is covered by the
  scoped `/etc/sudoers.d/pithead-firewall` grant.
- **Observe over Tailscale:** `ssh $BENCH_HOST bench-status`
  ([`bench-status.sh`](../../tests/integration/benchmarks/bench-status.sh)) prints a one-screen
  summary: current arm, day, last-OK, shares per arm, egress verdict, miners, collector. The
  dashboard UI (on the bench's Tailscale IP) is the live stack glance.

### Runbook

```bash
# 1. calibrate (~6–12 h, Tor arm): confirm live mini total, our share, shares/day
tests/integration/benchmarks/bench-orchestrate.sh --calibrate --pool mini

# 2. start the autonomous interleaved run + install the watchdog cron
#    (the exact invocation used for the run recorded in Results)
nohup tests/integration/benchmarks/bench-orchestrate.sh run \
      --pool mini --block-hours 20 --blocks 6 --settle-hours 3 --interval 300 >/dev/null 2>&1 &
tests/integration/benchmarks/bench-orchestrate.sh --install-cron   # */15 + @reboot watchdog

# 3. check from anywhere over Tailscale
ssh $BENCH_HOST bench-status
ssh $BENCH_HOST tail -n 40 pithead-bench/health.log

# 4. graceful stop (restores the Tor default + egress firewall + re-enables XvB, removes the cron, keeps the JSONL)
tests/integration/benchmarks/bench-orchestrate.sh --stop
```

## Decision rule

The clearnet arm establishes the **noise floor** (its own variance across sub-windows). Then:

- **Tor yield-efficiency / reward-share delta within that noise floor** ⇒ keep **Tor as the default**
  for that path (#165/#166 ship as-is); document the measured (negligible) trade-off.
- **Tor materially below clearnet** (a reward-share loss clearly outside the noise, especially if
  concentrated on `--mini`/`--nano`) ⇒ document the trade-off and reconsider: a **per-sidechain
  default**, or **clearnet-default with a Tor opt-in**, rather than a blanket Tor default.

Either way the conclusion lands in [`docs/privacy.md`](../privacy.md) so operators get an honest
trade-off, and it sets the final default for #165/#166 before the v1.1 release.

## Results

**Run:** `mini`, 2026-06-17 → 2026-06-22 (~5 days), 6 × 20h blocks interleaved T/C/T/C/T/C (3 per arm),
first 3h of each block discarded. Full **8-miner fleet ≈ 269 kH/s held constant**, **XvB disabled**
so the whole fleet hit p2pool in both arms. The sidechain grew from ~14.7 to ~20.9 MH/s over the run
(our share drifted ~1.8 % → ~1.3 %), which is why the yield-efficiency ratio (reward ÷
hashrate share) is the headline metric, not raw reward share. ~1,220 post-settle snapshots total.
Reproduce with `python3 tests/integration/benchmarks/bench-analyze.py docs/benchmarks/data/run-2026-06-17-mini`;
the raw per-arm JSONL plus `events.log` are committed there (originals on the test bench at `~/pithead-bench/`).

**Per-arm** (mean of the 3 block means; ± is the block-to-block stdev, the noise floor):

| Arm | Blocks | Reward share % | Yield-efficiency | Avg effort % | Shares | Rejects | Peers | Tor-daemon CPU |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| clearnet | 3 | **1.375 ± 0.132** | **1.054 ± 0.085** | 89.9 | 292 | 0 | 10.0 | 19.6 % |
| Tor | 3 | **1.218 ± 0.157** | **0.933 ± 0.098** | 112.9 | 270 | 0 | 10.2 | 18.7 % |
| **Δ (Tor vs clearnet)** | | **−11.4 %** | **−11.5 %** | +23 pts | −7.5 % | — | ≈0 | ≈0 |

**Per-block** (transparency; note the ranges overlap):

| Blk | Arm | Reward % | Yield-eff | Effort % | Shares |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Tor | 1.396 | 0.860 | 111.8 | 107 |
| 2 | clearnet | 1.543 | 0.969 | 95.6 | 111 |
| 3 | Tor | 1.013 | 0.869 | 125.0 | 76 |
| 4 | clearnet | 1.363 | 1.170 | 86.3 | 94 |
| 5 | Tor | 1.245 | 1.071 | 101.9 | 87 |
| 6 | clearnet | 1.220 | 1.024 | 87.7 | 87 |

**Findings:**

1. **Tor costs ≈ 10–12 % of p2pool yield** on `mini`. Reward share and yield-efficiency agree (−11.4 % /
   −11.5 %), and the direction is consistent across the run.
2. **The cost is propagation latency, not anything else.** Rejects were **0 in both arms**, the Tor
   daemon used the **same CPU** in both (~19 %, since monerod + Tari route over Tor regardless of arm),
   and peer counts matched (~10). The only moving part is share-propagation delay over Tor, which shows up
   as **higher effort on Tor (113 % vs 90 %)**: more hashing per counted share, i.e. more shares
   landing as uncles or too late for the PPLNS window.
3. **Confidence: moderate, not precise.** With 3 blocks per arm the ~11 % effect sits only modestly
   above the clearnet block-to-block noise floor (±8–10 %), and per-block yield-eff ranges overlap
   (Tor 0.86–1.07 vs clearnet 0.97–1.17). Read it as "**roughly 10 %**", economically real and
   directionally consistent, but not a tight point estimate. A longer run would narrow the interval.

**Recommendation — keep Tor the default (#165/#166 ship as-is in `develop`).** Per the decision rule
this is the "materially below clearnet" case, so the trade-off is documented rather than hidden. Not
exposing the operator's home IP to the P2Pool network is the project's core value, and **~10 % is a
modest, opt-out-able price** for it. Operators who prioritise yield over IP privacy can set
`p2pool.clearnet: true` (now functional; it was a no-op until the #294 firewall-toggle fix
found during this benchmark) and accept the exposure. No per-sidechain split is warranted: the
mechanism is the ~10 s share interval, common to every sidechain, so `mini` is representative. The
absolute cost is largest on the smaller, faster chains where our share, and thus uncle sensitivity,
is highest. This conclusion is mirrored operator-facing in [`../privacy.md`](../privacy.md).
